The anti-influenza virus medicament consists of antisense oligonucleotide ASO-mvtRNA1, antisense oligonucleotide ASO-mvtRNA2 and antisense oligonucleotide ASO-mvtRNA3. Experiments prove that after the anti-influenza virus medicament is used for interfering with vtRNAs, the replication capacity of influenza viruses obviously declines, which shows that the infection of the influenza viruses controls the expression of the vtRNAs to facilitate respective replication, so that the sensitivity of hosts to the infection of the influenza viruses can be reduced by reducing the expression of the vtRNAs; and the antisense oligonucleotides targeting the vtRNAs can be used as a potential anti-influenza virus medicament.',\n     'lang': 'en'}],\n

Hybrid ASOs, part single-stranded and part double-stranded, are provided, hybridising to form a double-stranded region that can non-covalently bond to nucleic-acid-binding protein regions. In this way, ASO::protein complexes may be produced that facilitate delivery of antisense DNA into target cells. Such complexes may be used to down-regulate gene expression in cells. Antisense oligonucleotides have been approved by the FDA for use as antivirals, for the treatment of cytomegalovirus-mediated retinitis and chronic ulcerative colitis (Roehr, 1998; Yacychyn et al, 1998). ASOs are comprised of segments of single-stranded DNA, or analogues thereof, that are designed to hybridise to a messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript, derived from a specific gene. The mRNA: : ASO hybrids so formed may be degraded by RNAse H. In an organism infected with a virus, the genetic material of the virus enters specific cells in order to replicate, a process requiring the translation of virus- specific mRNA. By treating an infected cell with an antisense oligonucleotide specific for virus mRNA, it is possible to prevent the expression of a target viral gene and to block the viral life cycle. An important factor in the effectiveness of antisense oligonucleotide treatment is the bioavailability of the oligonucleotides (Biroccio et al, 2003). Bioavailability can be limited by the inability of antisense oligonucleotides to penetrate the plasma membrane or endomembrane system of cells. Since the targets of antisense oligonucleotides {e.g., mRNA) are located within the cytosol of a cell, the oligonucleotides need to be able to traverse cell membranes before they can access the cytosol. One way to address this problem of cytosolic access of antisense oligonucleotides is to administer the treatment locally rather than systemically, and in particular, to administer the antisense oligonucleotide into a discrete pharmacokinetic compartment, raising the local concentration of the antisense oligonucleotide. For example, an antisense oligonucleotide treatment of cytomegalovirus-mediated retinitis involves administering fomivirsen (Vitravene ® ) into a discrete pharmacokinetic compartment by intravitreal injection. However, cytosolic access i.e., access of the antisense oligonucleotides to their target mRNA, remains a substantial limitation, even after intravitreal administration (Lysik and Wu-Pong, 2003). Other approaches to antisense oligonucleotide intracellular delivery may involve: mechanical and electrical cell damage to the cell membrane, polymeric and lipid carriers (known to non-specifically destabilise membranes), or viral vectors. However, these and similar approaches have not proved to be safe or reliable in the clinic and have not resulted (to date) in any delivery technologies licensed for antisense products in the market place. The present invention aims to provide compositions and methods for use in a system for the down-regulation of one or more genes within a cell by means of a novel arrangement of an active antisense sequence (e.g., of single-stranded DNA) flanking a partially overlapping second oligonucleotide strand that forms a binding site that can bind to a proteinaceous, nucleic-acid-binding domain. We term these partly single- and partly double-stranded nucleotides, \"ASO hybrids\". Unexpectedly, we have discovered and have shown empirically (unpublished data): 1) That ASO hybrids can show an equivalent antisense activity profile to the control single-stranded antisense oligonucleotide in a cell-free assay, for example at an ASO concentration of 30 pMol. 2) That ASO hybrids bind to a nucleic-acid-binding domain (such as S. cerevisiae GAL4) to form a complex without requiring a polycationic affinity handle (such as poly(L-lysine), used previously (Gaur et al, 2002; W097/23236)) or other covalent chemical conjugation methods. 3) That if, in an ASO hybrid complex (for example, GAL4: :ASO) the nucleic- acid-binding domain is fused to attenuated lethal factor domain 1 (from Bacillus anthracis, i.e., LFn), this supramolecular assembly can pass through a pore derived from a bacterial virulence factor {Bacillus anthracis PA63). This is unexpected as it is reported that passage through the PA pore requires the structural disassembly of cargo (molten globular transition) (Zornetta et al, 2010). For a supramolecular complex to transit into the cytosol via the PA pore, molten globular transition of the cargo, i.e., a transition from an ordered structure to a random coil, must not be taking place. Again this transition has been shown without the use of a polycationic affinity handle (such as poly(L-lysine) (Gaur et al, 2002: W097/23236)). It is a particular aim of the present invention to provide a conjugation strategy to enable compositions of antisense oligonucleotides to cross a cell membrane. In this way, antisense oligonucleotides can be delivered to the cytosol of a cell providing direct access to RNA or DNA targets within the cytosol (such as viral mRNA transcripts) via the described antisense-to-protein conjugation strategy. In one aspect, the present invention provides an antisense oligonucleotide composition comprising a pair of antisense oligonucleotides, wherein the two antisense oligonucleotides hybridise to give at least one single-stranded antisense sequence and at least one double- stranded protein-binding sequence. Preferably the composition further comprises a shuttle protein (e.g., recombinant LFn-GAL4), wherein the shuttle protein comprises a nucleic- acid-binding domain (for example GAL4) that recognises the double-stranded protein- binding sequence and wherein the shuttle protein is non-covalently bonded to the pair of antisense oligonucleotides. In another aspect, the present invention provides a system for delivering an antisense oligonucleotide across a membrane of a cell, the system comprising (i) a pair of antisense oligonucleotides, the pair comprising a double-stranded protein-binding sequence (e.g., GAL4) and at least one single-stranded antisense sequence (as shown for example in Figure 1), and (ii) a shuttle protein having a nucleic-acid-binding domain that is capable of recognising a specific sequence (e.g., CGG-Nn-CCG) incorporated within the double- stranded protein-binding nucleic acid sequence to non-covalently bind the shuttle protein to the pair of antisense oligonucleotides. In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of non-covalently conjugating an antisense oligonucleotide to a shuttle protein (e.g., LFn-GAL4), the method comprising: (i) providing two antisense oligonucleotides, (ii) hybridising the two antisense oligonucleotides to form an antisense hybrid, wherein the antisense hybrid comprises at least one single-stranded antisense sequence and at least one double-stranded protein- binding sequence, (iii) providing a shuttle protein containing a nucleic-acid-binding domain that recognises a double-stranded protein-binding target sequence, and (iv) non- covalently conjugating the shuttle protein to the antisense hybrid by means of the nucleic- acid-binding domain of the protein and the protein-binding sequence of the antisense hybrid. The method of conjugation and membrane translocation does not require the use of (polycationic or ionic) DNA condensing agents (such as poly(ethylene imine) or poly(L- Lysine)) as these materials are often toxic and this toxicity is thought to be due, at least in part, to their propensity to destabilise cell membranes (Richardson et al, 1999) (and see Table 1 below). In the context of the present invention, a shuttle protein is defined as a protein that is capable of conveying genetic material through a pore in a cell membrane. The pore may comprise a pore-forming protein, such as Bacillus anthracis PA83 or PA63. The oligonucleotides of the invention comprise nucleic acid sequences, which may be of DNA or DNA analogues, for example sulphonated analogues in which certain oxygen atoms are replaced by sulphur. Other DNA analogues that may be found suitable include those disclosed by Leumann (2002). The sequences may directly adjoin each other or be connected by an intervening DNA sequence, preferably at least partly double-stranded. In a preferred embodiment, the shuttle protein is an attenuated toxin protein. In particular, the shuttle protein may be B. anthracis lethal factor domain I (LFn). Preferably, in the attenuated toxin, at least one toxin domain, e.g., one or more of toxic domains II-IV of the B. anthracis lethal factor protein toxin, is replaced by a nucleic-acid- binding domain. For example, the nucleic-acid-binding domain may be Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL4 (fused with LFn). Advantageously, the antisense oligonucleotide composition further comprises a pore- forming protein. Preferably, the pore-forming protein is a non-toxic protein. One preferred pore-forming protein is B. anthracis virulence factor Protective Antigen (PA). In particular, the pore-forming protein may be B. anthracis PA83 or PA63. In one embodiment, (in the instance of targeting syntaxin5 (Syn5) for down-regulation) one of the oligonucleotides includes the antisense sequence 5\\' AATTTGTTTGTTGAGGCTA 3\\' (SEQ ID No: 18). Each member of the antisense oligonucleotide pair comprises one of the two complementary strands that hybridise to form the protein-binding sequence (see Figure 1). The antisense sequence may be downstream (3\\') or upstream (5\\') of the protein-binding sequence (or both, if there is more than one antisense sequence in the hybrid that results) (see Figure la). In one embodiment, the protein-binding sequence is CGG-Nn-CCG where \"N\" is any nucleotide comprising a purine or pyrimidine base. Suitably, the protein-binding sequence is 5\\' CGGCTGCTCTGATGCCG 3\\' (SEQ ID No: 19). Advantageously, the antisense oligonucleotide composition comprises oligonucleotide pairs that hybridise to form a protein-binding sequence that includes the sequence: 5\\' CGGCATCAGAGCAGCCG 3\\' (SEQ ID No: 20). Examples of such sequences are SEQ ID Nos 9, 11 and 13 shown below (Example 4). In one embodiment, the oligonucleotide further comprises a flanking sequence between the protein-binding sequence and the antisense sequence (see Figure la). Advantageously, the oligonucleotides used in the present invention may be sulphonated, thereby increasing their stability. In sulphonated oligonucleotides, one or more non- bridging oxygen atoms in the oligonucleotide chain may be replaced by sulphur atoms. Sulphonation may be effected by various known methods, for example by use of Beaucage Reagent (3H-l,2-benzodithiole-3-one-l, l, -dioxide) (Cieslak et al, 2005). Other ways of increasing stability of oligonucleotides may be employed in the invention: for example, those disclosed in Leumann (2002). The present invention also provides an in vitro method of down-regulating the expression of a target gene in the cytosol of a cell by delivering an antisense oligonucleotide across a membrane of the cell using an antisense oligonucleotide composition as described above. An alternative aspect of the present invention is an antisense oligonucleotide composition as described above for use in a method of down-regulating the expression of a gene from Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) in a human cervical epithelial cell (see Figure 5 and Example 7). In a further aspect, the present invention provides an antisense oligonucleotide composition as described above as a potential treatment or prophylaxis for cancer, in particular cancers caused by human papilloma virus (HPV), including cervical cancer and oral cancers. Many plant and bacterial toxins (virulence factors) have evolved to deliver a toxin, in the form of a macromolecular catalytically-active protein domain, to the cytosol of a cell. Examples include cholera toxin (Sandvig et al, 2005), ricin toxin (Sandvig et al, 2010) and anthrax toxin (Gaur et al, 2002). These agents are known to operate in vivo, causing human morbidity and mortality. The present inventors have prepared a known attenuated version of Bacillus anthracis lethal factor (LFn), where the wild-type domains II-IV (responsible for catalytic toxic activity) have been removed using recombinant PCR. These domains (II-IV) have subsequently been replaced with a nucleic-acid-binding domain such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL4. All of this is known in the art (Gaur et al, 2002). The inventors have shown that GAL4 can bind, indirectly, to active antisense oligonucleotides under suitable conditions i.e., when two suitable oligonucleotides are hybridised together to form a hybrid containing a single-stranded antisense sequence and a double-stranded (DS) protein- binding sequence. The inventors have further shown that the complete complex (LFn- GAL4: :ASO) can be used to translocate antisense oligonucleotides into the cytosol of a cell via interaction with another protein, PA83. Significantly, the processes and materials employed by the inventors to generate the complete antisense oligonucleotide - protein complex mean that condensing agents or polycation affinity handles hitherto regarded as necessary for DNA complex formation in the art (such as poly(L-lysine) (Gaur et al, 2002; W097/23236), which is toxic and known to destabilise membranes (Richardson et al, 1999)) are not required. A preferred embodiment of a system in accordance with the present invention provides a single-stranded antisense oligonucleotide sequence 3\\' and/or 5\\' to a double-stranded (DS) protein-binding sequence. Proteins such as LFn may be used in conjunction with pore- forming proteins, for example PA83. PA83 has the capacity to enhance the membrane translocation of LFn. The interaction between LFn and PA83 is described elsewhere (Krantz et al, 2005) though it has been documented to require the molten-globular transition of cargo during pore translocation. We have now shown that it is possible to use a supramolecular assembly as cargo and that an antisense sequence associated with that supramolecular assembly can translocate into the cytosol. This could not have been predicted. The inventors have further developed the system to use hybridised oligonucleotide containing a double-stranded LFn-GAL4 binding sequence and a 3 \\' and/or 5\\' overhanging single-stranded antisense sequence, which they have shown to be no less effective than the antisense (single-stranded nucleotide) sequence without any flanking sequence at antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) concentrations above 30pMol. The complex developed by the inventors can be used as an antisense oligonucleotide conjugation system to facilitate antisense oligonucleotide cytosolic delivery without a covalent attachment between the oligonucleotides and the LFn-GAL4 protein. The present invention provides a useful tool for in vitro research as well as a basis for an antisense oligonucleotide pharmaceutical composition and a critical part of the delivery methodology of any suitable antisense therapy. In particular, the present invention may form the basis for an antisense antiviral composition for the treatment of UPV-infected cervical epithelial cells. The dimerisation of the LFn-GAL4 protein in response to the presence of a double- stranded protein-recognition nucleic acid sequence adjacent to the antisense sequence has been shown using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) (see Example 5). Example 5 shows that the protein LFn-GAL4 forms high molecular weight complexes (protein radius of gyration (R g ) expanding from approximately 5nm to 25nm) upon the addition of the hybrid oligonucleotide compositions of the invention. In order to test a three-component system in accordance with the present invention, the inventors initially produced a prototype. The system\\'s ability to down-regulate genes was tested in human epithelial cells (Hela). The LFn-GAL4: oligonucleotide composite, when mixed with PA83 facilitates the down-regulation of the specific, selected gene (see Example 6), corresponding to the antisense sequence. With reference to Example 6, this illustrates the down-regulation of the protein Syntaxin5 by Western blotting and immunodetection (Suga et al, 2005). Gene specificity (as well as controlling for cell number) is further emphasised by normalising the levels of target gene expression to the expression levels of a \"housekeeper\" gene such as Derlinl and through the inclusion of \"non-sense\" controls (see Figure 4). \\'Non-sense\\' controls are controls that include single- stranded DNA that is not complementary to target RNA in the gene being expressed, and accordingly are not expected to inhibit its expression. In addition antisense activity is also shown against the expression of the HPV gene E7 (see Example 7). HPV E7 is critical to the propagation of the HPV viral life cycle and is a target for therapeutic intervention (Jonson et al, 2008). The arrangement of two oligonucleotide strands to provide a double-stranded protein- binding region or sequence, whilst leaving free single-stranded regions of sequence that have antisense activity provides a convenient conjugation method that can be used to bind the antisense domains to agents already described in the art (such as LFn-GAL4 and PA83). This facilitates the cytosolic delivery of the antisense agents that can mediate the down-regulation of genes coding for potential drug targets, for example HPV E7. Specific embodiments to the invention are now described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1 comprises Figures la to le showing five different compositions according to the invention, illustrating different topologies for creating a double-stranded protein-binding site from a pair of single-stranded antisense oligonucleotides; Figure 2 compares inhibitory activity of a composition according to the invention with other antisense compositions in a cell-free assay. Figure 3, by using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), shows that in the presence of antisense compositions of the invention, LFn-GAL4 dimerise to form compositions of higher molecular weight. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate how the described system can down-regulate expression of two different genes: down-regulating the expression of Syntaxin5 is shown in Figure 4 and of FIPV (serotype 18) Early (E)7 is shown in Figure 5; Figure 6 is the LFn-GAL4 nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID No: 1); Figure 7 is the LFn (LF domain I) protein sequence (SEQ ID No: 2); Figure 8 is the GAL4 (amino acids 1-147) protein sequence (SEQ ID No: 3); Figure 9 is the V5-LFn-GAL4-6His DNA sequence (SEQ ID No: 4); Figure 10 is the V5-LFn-GAL4-6His protein sequence (SEQ ID No: 5); Figure 11 is the MRGS-6His-PA83 DNA sequence (SEQ ID No: 6); and Figure 12 is the MRGS-6His-PA83 protein sequence (SEQ ID No: 7). Example 1: Formation of shuttle protein LFn-GAL4 was enriched from cultures of E. coli with a yield of approximately 5 mg/1. The DNA sequence coding for the protein LFn-GAL4 is SEQ ID No: 4 (Figure 9) . This sequence is within the plasmid pET151/D (Invitrogen), an E.coli expression cassette. The DNA sequence for LFn (LF domain 1) and GAL4 (amino-acids 1-147) (known in the art - Gaur et al, 2002) was sub-cloned into the pET151/D bacterial expression cassette. The addition of a V5 epitope tag at the N-terminus and 6x histidine affinity tag at the C- terminus allowed for the rapid immunodetection and affinity purification, respectively, of the fusion protein from bacterial lysate. Recombinant protein production: Chemically competent bacteria {E.coli BL21 *DE3 (Invitrogen)) were transformed with purified plasmid (described above) and cultured overnight (10 mL) in 2x yeast extract tyrptone (2xYT) bacterial culture, containing ampicillin (200 μg/ml) media prior to sub-culturing in large volumes (1L) of 2xYT also containing a similar concentration of ampicillin. Bacterial cultures were then incubated in an orbital shaker set at 180 rpm (at 37°C) for 3 hours. Subsequently isopropyl β-D-l- thiogalactopyrnoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 500 μΜ and incubated for a further 3 hours. Bacterial pellets were prepared by centrifugation (6 OOOxg for 10 min at 4°C) and subject to lysis using a French Press set to 1500 PSI. Bacterial lysates were subjected to further centrifugation (20 OOOxg for 20 min). The resultant supernatant was passed over a 6xHis (Co 2+ Tallon® resin (Clontech)) affinity chromatography column. LFn-GAL4 was eluted using 150 mM imidazole in fractions of 1 mL. Fractions were analysed for protein purity and concentration, pooled and dialysed in phosphate buffered saline. The final protein preparation was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Coomassie staining (to determine protein purity) and Western blot analysis (using an antibody specific to V5 and 6xHis). Example 2: Production of pore-forming protein PA83 was enriched from cultures of E. coli BL21 *DE3 with a yield of approximately 5 mg/1. A plasmid containing the known DNA sequence encoding PA83 was obtained as a gift from Professor Les Baillie (University of Cardiff). It contained the PA83-encoding sequence sub-cloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE30 providing an N-terminal 6x histidine affinity tag (Baillie et al, 2010). Chemically competent bacteria were transformed with purified plasmid and cultured overnight as before. During the growth phase, the 1/ bacterial cultures were incubated in an orbital shaker set at 180 rpm (at 37°C) for 3 hours. Subsequently IPTG was added to a final concentration of 500 μΜ and incubated for a further 2 hours. Bacterial pellets were prepared by centrifugation (6 OOOxg for 10 min) and subjected to lysis using a French Press as before. Bacterial lysates were subjected to further centrifugation (20 OOOxg for 20 min). The resultant supernatant was passed over a 6x histidine affinity chromatography column. PA was eluted using 150 mM imidazole in fractions of 1 mL. Protein fractions were analysed for purity and concentration, pooled, and dialysed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The final protein preparation was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Coomassie staining (to determine purity) and western blot analysis (using an antibody specific to PA). The amino-acid sequence for PA83 is shown in SEQ ID No: 7 (Figure 12 -MRGS-6His- PA83 protein). Example 3: Formation of antisense oligonucleotide with double-stranded protein- binding region Two complementary oligonucleotides, each encoding one strand of a GAL4 recognition sequence, were annealed, to form a double- stranded (GAL4) protein-binding sequence with flanking single-stranded antisense sequences. The ASO compositions described (SEQ ID Nos: 8 & 9: see Example 4) were used in this instance. The resulting composition is shown in Figure la. Antisense oligonucleotide hybridization was performed by repeated (xlO) thermal cycling, melting (1 min. at 94°C) and re-annealing (1 min. at 55°C) the two partially overlapping oligonucleotides, leaving single-strand antisense oligonucleotide sequence free to interact with mRNA in a sequence-specific manner. Figures la - le show several possible topologies of the protein-binding (DS) sequence of DNA (or DNA analogues) in relation to the antisense nucleic acid sequence(s) using the protein: : oligonucleotide conjugation strategy disclosed herein. Figure la shows two sequences SEQ ID Nos: 8 and 9 oriented in opposite senses and bonded together by complementary sections - bases 23 to 48 in SEQ ID No: 8 bonding with bases 48 to 23 of SEQ ID No. 9 (SEQ ID No. 9 is shown 3\\' to 5\\' in Figure la). The ASO hybrids of our invention may or may not include an additional DNA sequence flanking the antisense sequence(s). As shown in Figures la - le, the double-stranded (protein-binding) region of the ASO hybrid can be formed in a number of different ways. For example, the double- stranded region can be positioned between two antisense sequences (which may be identical or different), as in Figure la. Alternatively, the double-stranded region can be positioned at one side of a single antisense oligonucleotide, as in Figures lb-le. Example 4: Production of DNA sequences useful for inhibiting expression of specific proteins Antisense oligonucleotide sequence specific for Syntaxin5 with flanking and GAL4 binding sequence: Forward oligonucleotide (SEQ ID No: 8) 5\\' AATTTGTTTGTTGAGGCTAATGCATGCCGGCTGCTCTGATGCCGGCAT 3\\' Reverse oligonucleotide (SEQ ID No: 9) 5\\' AATTTGTTTGTTGAGGCTAATGCATGCCGGCATCAGAGCAGCCGGCAT 3\\' Antisense oligonucleotide sequence specific for HPV (serotype 18) Early (E) 7 mRNA transcripts, with flanking and GAL4 binding sequence: Forward oligonucleotide (SEQ ID No: 10) 5\\' GGTCGTCTGCTGAGCTTTCTATGCATGCCGGCTGCTCTGATGCCGGCAT 3\\' Reverse oligonucleotide (SEQ ID No: 11) 5\\' GGTCGTCTGCTGAGCTTTCTATGCATGCCGGCATCAGAGCAGCCGGCAT 3\\' Antisense oligonucleotide sequence specific for TurboGFP mRNA transcripts, with flanking and GAL4 binding sequence: Forward oligonucleotide (SEQ ID No: 12) 5\\' GGTGCTCTTCATCTTGTTGGTATGCATGCCGGCTGCTCTGATGCCGGCAT 3\\' Reverse oligonucleotide (SEQ ID No: 13) 5\\' GGTGCTCTTCATCTTGTTGGTATGCCGGCATCAGAGCAGCCGGCATGCAT 3\\' The above oligonucleotides (SEQ ID Nos: 8-13) were synthesised with phosphorothioate modification to enhance the lifetime of the antisense oligonucleotide. Forward and reverse primer pairs (SEQ ID Nos 8 with 9; 10 with 11; 12 with 13) were hybridized using a PCR cycler using the following conditions: Heated to 94°C for 1 min., and cooled to 55°C for 1 min., xlO. This annealing process produced hybrid single- and double-stranded DNA sequences according to the invention. Example 5: Formation of an antisense oligonucleotide-shuttle (LFn-GAL4) complex Annealed ASO hybrids were produced (as in Example 4). These ASO hybrids were co- incubated with LFn-GAL4 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at room temperature at the appropriate stoichiometry {i.e., at approximately a 3 : 1 protein to oligonucleotide molar ratio). One such product so obtained was investigated by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). The profile resulting is compared in Figure 3 with that obtained in the absence of any antisense oligonucleotide. Figure 3 shows LFn-GAL4 dimerisation as measured by SANS in response to the addition of the antisense oligonucleotide composition shown in Figure la - small angle neutron scattering by LFn-GAL4 and LFn-GAL4: :DS-antisense oligonucleotide in PBS (at approximately 0.5 mg/ml of LFn-GAL4 in each instance). Units of the x-axis of Figure 3 are q/l/angstrom and of the y-axis are 1/cm. The upper thick black line shows results in the presence of the ASO, in comparison with the lower thin line where the ASO is absent. The differential in scattering profile between 0.01 and 0.04 (q/l/A) is attributable to the LFn-GAL4 dimerising, caused by association with the double-stranded protein-binding sequence forming part of the oligonucleotide (Figure la). In this instance 2mm cuvettes (Hellman Analytics, Essex, UK) were loaded with LFn-GAL4 and LFn- GAL4: :oligonucleotide stoichiometry of 3 : 1 respectively (molar ratio). The intensity of such scattered radiation is a reflection of the scatterer size and shape, as well as composition (i.e., LFn-GAL4). Both the individual proteins and their blends were examined. For the individual components, generally no scattering was observed, indicating their relatively small size. In the mixture of LFn-GAL4 and the hybridised oligonucleotide, scattering was observed, confirming that an interaction was occurring to form larger structures (i.e., LFn-GAL4: :ASO complexes). Example 6: Down-regulation of target gene expression (Syntaxin5) One of the complexes produced in Example 5 was employed to target the expression of the gene Syntaxin5 in Hela cells. The pore-forming protein PA83 was used to help mediate antisense oligonucleotide membrane translocation via an interaction with LFn-GAL4. The ASO portion of the complex consisted of two annealed (as in Example 4) ASO sequences (SEQ ID Nos: 8 & 9). Hela cells produce Syntaxin5 when cultured under normal conditions. Hela cells were treated in various ways at a range of ASO complex concentrations: 0 (control), 1, 10, 50, 100 and 200 pMol per litre. In Figure 4: the black filled bar represents Hela cells treated with PA83, LFn-GAL4 and a \"non-Syntaxin5\" (GFP specific) ASO (formed from hybridised SEQ ID No: 12 and 13). The bar with no fill represents Hela cells treated with PBS only. These two treatments show sequence specificity for Syntaxin5 down-regulation (since the anti-GFP ASO sequence here is inactive against Syntaxin5) and serve as negative controls. Bars filled with horizontal hatching represent Hela cells electroporated with hybrid ASO specific for Syntaxin5 (formed from SEQ ID Nos: 8 and 9). Bars filled with vertical hatching represent Hela cells treated with PA83, LFn-GAL4 and hybrid ASO specific for Syntaxin5 (formed from SEQ ID Nos: 8 and 9). The bars filled with diagonal hatching represent Hela cells treated with hybrid ASO specific for Syntaxin5 (formed from SEQ ID Nos: 8 and 9) mixed with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer\\'s recommendations. Syntaxin5 expression levels in the cells were measured after 24 hours using immunoblotting. Results are shown as % expression of control (Hela cells treated with PBS only) (y axis). The data show that compositions according to the invention down- regulate Syntaxin5 expression in a gene-specific manner. This is shown at a population level by Western blotting and immunodetection. The graph of Figure 4 displays Syntaxin5 expression levels and shows the effect of loading antisense oligonucleotide hybrids (3^g/mL) (SEQ ID Nos: 8 and 9) onto LFn-GAL4 (5(^g/mL) co-incubated with PA (5C^g/mL) on Hela cells relative to the expression of a housekeeper gene, Derlinl (to control for any variation in cell number). The data shown is derived from 3 separate experiments and demonstrates that the addition of the compositions described can mediate the knockdown of a specific gene antisense oligonucleotide encoding an antisense sequence (i.e., Syntaxin5). The data represent three repeats of each experiment and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean. Example 7: Down-regulation of target gene expression (HPV18 E7) An experiment to examine the efficacy of anti-HPV E7 antisense oligonucleotides against the expression of Human Papilloma Virus (serotype 18) Early 7 in Hela cells was undertaken as described in Example 6 above, but using different oligonucleotide sequences. In this instance the Syntaxin5-specific ASO hybrids (formed from SEQ ID No: 8 and SEQ ID No: 9) of Example 6 were replaced with HPV-E7-specific ASO hybrid also containing the hybrid protein-binding region and a small flanking region (formed from SEQ ID No: 10 and SEQ ID No: 11). In this example 200 pM of oligonucleotide, associated with LFn-GAL4 and PA83, was used (this is the black bar on the graph in Figure 5). The result is shown in Figure 5: % gene expression is shown on the y axis. The control treatment, PBS, is taken as 100%: this is the white bar on the graph in Figure 5. The data represent three repeats of each experiment and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean. There was a statistical difference between the two treatments (p= 0.0104 as measured by a one-tailed, unpaired t-test). Example 8: In vitro toxicity of compositions of the invention compared with poly(ethyleneimine) The ASO hybrid-shuttle complexes produced as in Example 5 were tested for toxicity in relation to poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) (Table 1). These data show a differential in toxicity relative to cells exposed to varying concentrations of either PEI, a cationic polymer well characterised in the literature as being able to mediate transfection, and LFn-GAL4 protein after hybridisation with ASO hybrids in the presence of 5C^g/mL PA over 72h. Cell viability was normalised to untreated cells and measured by the addition of MTT (Richardson et al, 1999). Table 1 Example 9: Antisense inhibition of an in vitro translation assay using different antisense oligonucleotide compositions Figure 2 shows the effect of compositions of the invention as compared with component ASOs in a cell-free assay (where membrane translocation is not rate-limiting). Control reactions were performed using a \"One step human high yield mini- in vitro translation kit\" (Thermo Scientific), in conjunction with a control plasmid encoding the protein turboGFP (green fluorescent protein - Evrogen). The reactions were performed in 4.5 μΐ volumes (incubated for 3h at 30°C) and the expression of turboGFP was monitored by Western immunoblotting using an anti-6His primary antibody (1 : 1000 dilution) and an anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1 : 1000). Detection was performed using a Picostable ECL kit (GE Healthcare). Three anti-turbo GFP antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) compositions were added to the reaction at differing concentrations at the beginning of the 3h incubation period previously described. Results are shown in Figure 2, (n=3 ± SEM) relative to a control containing no antisense oligonucleotides. In Figure 2 the y-axis represents the expression of turboGPF (%) relative to an untreated control, while the x-axis represents concentration of antisense oligonucleotide added to the reaction (in pMol). The data points represented with a square were derived from a single-stranded ASO oligonucleotide, SEQ ID No: 12, consisting of the turboGPF antisense sequence and (one strand of the) protein-binding sequence. The data points represented by triangles represent data generated from only the antisense sequence incorporated into SEQ ID No: 12 (i.e., the 21-mer GGTGCTCTTCATCTTGTTGGA, SEQ ID No: 21). The data points represented by circles were generated from the ASO hybrid of the invention formed by annealing together SEQ ID Nos: 12 and 13. The results shown in Figure 2 illustrate that (in vitro) the presence of the protein-binding sequence in the ASO hybrid does not inhibit the activity of the antisense sequence above an ASO concentration of 30 pMol. Our invention may be used to produce antisense compositions having substantially no significantly reduced antisense activity (as measured in cell-free assay), relative to an antisense control having no protein-binding sequence or flanking sequence, at or above a 30pMol concentration of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). Example 9 above (Figure 2) illustrates this. References: Baillie L.W. (2009) Is new always better than old?: The development of human vaccines for anthrax. Hum Vaccine, 5(12):806-16.

[0051] Antisense therapy provides a selective, sequence-specific modulation of gene expression and exon splicing by single-stranded oligonucleotides. The functions of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) require suitable chemistry with desired properties including resistance to nuclease activity, avoidance of toxicity, protein binding for gymnotic delivery, and enhanced thermodynamic stability of binding. These properties place differing demands on backbone chemistry such as phosphorothioate backbone linkages and morpholino oligonucleotides which can have improved nuclease resistance and melting temperature but poor delivery. While some other backbone chemistries may be favorable for activity but can cause increased toxicity. [0052] Disclosed herein include oligonucleotide constructs and complexes that can achieve enhanced sequence selectivity and potency with reduced cytotoxicity while improving delivery efficiency. [0053] Disclosed herein includes a stem-loop oligonucleotide construct. The stem-loop oligonucleotide comprises a single-stranded overhang comprising 4-16 linked nucleotides; a double-stranded stem region formed by a first region base-pairing with a second region, wherein the first region is linked to the single-stranded overhang and wherein the single-stranded overhang and the first region forms an antisense oligonucleotide domain comprising a sequence complementary to a target nucleic acid; and a hairpin loop comprising unpaired nucleotides. The singled-stranded overhang is capable of binding to the target nucleic acid to cause displacement of the first region from the second region. [0054] Disclosed herein also includes a method of modulating a target nucleic acid. The method comprises contacting a cell comprising a target nucleic acid with the stem-loop oligonucleotide described herein.

[0055] Disclosed herein also includes a method of treating a disease or a condition. The method comprises administering the stem -loop oligonucleotide disclosed herein to a subject in need thereof. The single- stranded overhang binds to a target nucleic acid to cause displacement of the first region from the second region and binding of the first region to the target nucleic acid, thereby modulating the activity of the target nucleic acid or protein expression from the target nucleic acid in the subject to treat the disease or condition. [0056] Disclosed herein also include a duplex oligonucleotide complex for delivering an antisense oligonucleotide.

The first single-stranded overhang in the antisense oligonucleotide strand is capable of binding to a target nucleic acid to cause displacement of the first domain from the second domain, thereby releasing the antisense oligonucleotide strand from the double-stranded duplex structure. [00571 Disclosed herein also includes a method of delivering an antisense oligonucleotide strand to a cell. The method comprises contacting the cell with the duplex oligonucleotide complex described herein, wherein the first single- stranded overhang in the antisense oligonucleotide strand binds to a target nucleotide in the cell to cause displacement of the first domain from the second domain, thereby releasing the antisense oligonucleotide strand from the double-stranded duplex structure.

The term “nucleoside analog” or “modified nucleoside” refers to a non-standard nucleoside comprising one or more modification (e g chemical modification), including non-naturally occurring nucleosides other than cytidine, uridine, adenosine, guanosine, and thymidine. The modified nucleoside can be a modified nucleotide without a phosphate group. The chemical modifications can include replacement of one or more atoms or moieties with a different atom or a different moiety or functional group (e.g. methyl group or hydroxyl group). [0065] The term “phosphorothioate linkage” (PS) as used herein, indicates a bond between nucleotides in which one of the nonbridging oxygens is replaced by a sulfur. In some embodiments, both nonbridging oxygens may be replaced by a sulfur (PS2). The term “phosphodiester linkage” as described herein indicates the normal sugar phosphate backbone linkage in DNA and RNA wherein a phosphate bridges the two sugars. [0066] As used herein, the term “locked nucleic acids” (LNA) indicates a modified RNA nucleotide. The ribose moiety of an LNA nucleotide is modified with an extra bridge connecting the 2\\' and 4\\' carbons (a 2’-O, 4’-C methylene bridge). The bridge “locks” the ribose in the 3\\'-endo structural conformation and restricts the flexibility of the ribofuranose ring, thereby locking the structure into a rigid bicyclic formation. LNA nucleotides can be mixed with DNA or RNA bases in the oligonucleotide whenever desired. The incorporation of LNA into the nucleic acid complexes disclosed herein can increase the thermal stability (e.g. melting temperature), hybridization specificity of oligonucleotides as well as accuracies in allelic discrimination. LNA oligonucleotides display hybridization affinity toward complementary single-stranded RNA and complementary single- or double-stranded DNA. Additional information about LNA can be found, for example, at www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/biology/locked-nucleic-acids-faq.html. [0067] The term “morpholino” or “morpholino oligomer” refers to a synthetic antisense oligonucleotide, typically around 25 nucleotides in length, designed to bind and block the translation initiation complex of messenger RNA sequences. The molecular structure of a morpholino contains nucleic bases attached to a backbone of methylenemorpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups. [0068] The term “gapmer” refers to a chimeric oligomeric compound comprising a DNA antisense oligonucleotide structure with RNA-like segments (or RNA-mimics) on both sides of the antisense sequence. [0069] A single-stranded polynucleotide has a 5’ terminus or 5\\' end and a 3’ terminus or 3\\' end. The terms “5\\' end” “5’ terminus” and “3\\' end” “3’ terminus” of a single-stranded polynucleotide indicate the terminal residues of the single-stranded polynucleotide and are distinguished based on the nature of the free group on each extremity. The 5 \\'-terminus of a singlestranded polynucleotide designates the terminal residue of the single-stranded polynucleotide that has the fifth carbon in the sugar-ring of the deoxyribose or ribose at its terminus (5\\' terminus). The 3 \\'-terminus of a single-stranded polynucleotide designates the residue terminating at the hydroxyl group of the third carbon in the sugar-ring of the nucleotide or nucleoside at its terminus (3\\' terminus). The 5\\' terminus and 3\\' terminus in various cases can be modified chemically or biologically e.g. by the addition of functional groups or other compounds as will be understood by the skilled person. [0070] As used herein, the terms “complementary binding” and “bind complementarily” mean that two single strands are base paired to each other to form nucleic acid duplex or doublestranded nucleic acid. The term “base pair” as used herein indicates formation of hydrogen bonds between base pairs on opposite complementary polynucleotide strands or sequences following the Watson-Crick base pairing rule. For example, in the canonical Watson-Crick DNA base pairing, adenine (A) forms a base pair with thymine (T) and guanine (G) forms a base pair with cytosine (C). In RNA base paring, adenine (A) forms a base pair with uracil (U) and guanine (G) forms a base pair with cytosine (C). A certain percentage of mismatches between the two single strands are allowed as long as a stable double- stranded duplex can be formed. In some embodiments, the two strands that bind complementarily can have a mismatches can be, about, be at most, or be at most bout 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 31%, 32%, 33%, 34%, 35%, 36%, 37%, 38%, 39%, 40%, 41%, 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%, 49%, or 50%. [0071] As used herein, the term “prophylaxis,” “prevent,” “preventing,” “prevention,” and grammatical variations thereof as used herein refers the preventive treatment of a subclinical disease-state in a subject, e.g., a mammal (including a human), for reducing the probability of the occurrence of a clinical disease-state. The method can partially or completely delay or preclude the onset or recurrence of a disorder or condition and/or one or more of its attendant symptoms or barring a subject from acquiring or reacquiring a disorder or condition or reducing a subject’s risk of acquiring or requiring a disorder or condition or one or more of its attendant symptoms. The subject is selected for preventative therapy based on factors that are known to increase risk of suffering a clinical disease state compared to the general population. “Prophylaxis” therapies can be divided into (a) primary prevention and (b) secondary prevention. Primary prevention is defined as treatment in a subject that has not yet presented with a clinical disease state, whereas secondary prevention is defined as preventing a second occurrence of the same or similar clinical disease state. [0072] As used herein, “treatment” refers to a clinical intervention made in response to a disease, disorder or physiological condition manifested by a patient or to which a patient may be susceptible. The aim of treatment includes, but is not limited to, the alleviation or prevention of symptoms, slowing or stopping the progression or worsening of a disease, disorder, or condition and/or the remission of the disease, disorder or condition. \"Treatments\" refer to one or both of therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Subjects in need of treatment include those already affected by a disease or disorder or undesired physiological condition as well as those in which the disease or disorder or undesired physiological condition is to be prevented. A treatment is considered “effective treatment,” if any one or all of the signs or symptoms of, as but one example, levels of functional target are altered in a beneficial manner (e.g., increased by at least 10%), or other clinically accepted symptoms or markers of disease (e.g., cancer) are improved or ameliorated. Efficacy can also be measured by failure of a subject to worsen as assessed by hospitalization or need for medical interventions (e.g., progression of the disease is halted or at least slowed). Methods of measuring these indicators are known to those of skill in the art and/or described herein. Treatment includes any treatment of a disease in subject and includes: (1) inhibiting the disease, e.g., arresting, or slowing the progression of symptoms; or (2) relieving the disease, e.g., causing regression of symptoms; and (3) preventing or reducing the likelihood of the development of symptoms. [0073] As used herein, a “subject” refers to an animal for whom a diagnosis, treatment, or therapy is desired. I some embodiments, the subject is a mammal. “Mammal,” as used herein, refers to an individual belonging to the class Mammalia and includes, but not limited to, humans, domestic and farm animals, zoo animals, sports and pet animals. Non-limiting examples of mammals include mice; rats; rabbits; guinea pigs; dogs; cats; sheep; goats; cows; horses; primates, such as monkeys, chimpanzees and apes, and, in particular, humans. In some embodiments, the mammal is a primate. In some embodiments, the mammal is a human. In some embodiments, the mammal is not a human. Stem-loop antisense oligonucleotide [0074] Provided herein include a stem-loop oligonucleotide comprising an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) domain linked to a protection domain together forming a hairpin or stemloop structure. The oligonucleotide herein described can be conditionally activated upon a complementary binding to a target nucleic acid (e.g., mRNA of a target gene) through a toehold or single-stranded overhang region in the ASO domain. The binding between the single-stranded overhang and the target nucleic acid can cause toehold-mediated displacement of the ASO domain from the protection domain and subsequent binding of the ASO domain (or a portion thereof) and the target nucleic acid, thereby modulating the target nucleic acid. [0075] As used herein, a “stem loop” or a “hairpin” refers to a secondary structure formed by a single-stranded oligonucleotide when complementary bases in a first section of the single-stranded oligonucleotide hybridizes with bases in a second section of the same oligonucleotide (e.g., downstream or upstream of the first section) to form a stem structure having intramolecular base-pairing between complementary bases. The intramolecular base-pairing do not occur in the portion of the oligonucleotide that forms a hairpin loop structure adjacent to the stem structure. [0076] In the absence of a target nucleic acid or a detectable amount of the target nucleic acid, the antisense oligonucleotide herein described remains in an inactivated state (OFF state) forming a hairpin or stem loop structure (see, for example, FIG. 1). A portion of the ASO domain and the protection domain are bound to each other through complementary binding forming a double-stranded stem. The double-stranded stem structure is able to block the antisense activity of the ASO domain and keep the ASO in the OFF state. The length of the double-stranded stem can vary in different embodiments. In some embodiments, the double-stranded stem can be 4-25 nucleotides in length. For example, the length of the double-stranded stem can be, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or a range of any two of these values, nucleotides. In some embodiments, the length of the double- stranded stem is about 6-12 (e.g., 6, 8, 10, or 12) nucleotides. [0077] A stem-loop ASO herein described can comprise a single-stranded overhang comprising about 4-16 nucleosides linked together, a double-stranded stem region formed by a first region (a section in the ASO domain, also referred to as “a protected domain”) base-pairing with a second region (also referred to as “a protection domain”), and a hairpin loop comprising unpaired nucleotides. The hairpin loop connects the ASO domain to the protection domain. The singlestranded overhang together with the protected domain form the ASO domain comprising a sequence complementary to a target nucleic acid. The single- stranded overhang or toehold is capable of binding to the target nucleic acid, thereby initiating a toehold-mediated strand displacement of the protected domain from the protection domain and allowing the target nucleic acid to hybridize with the protected domain in the ASO domain. In some embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide is single-stranded oligonucleotide. In some embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide forms a single-stranded hairpin structure. [0078] FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic representation of a non-limiting exemplary hairpin antisense oligonucleotide. The hairpin antisense oligonucleotide can comprise an ASO domain linked to a protection domain via a hairpin loop (anchor domain), in which the ASO domain comprises a toehold (or single-stranded overhang) and a section base-pairing with the protection domain. The toehold can be located at the 3’ or 5’ of the antisense oligonucleotide. Similarly, the protection domain can be located at the 5’ or 3’ of the antisense oligonucleotide. One or more nucleotides in the antisense oligonucleotide, including the toehold, the first region, the hairpin loop and the second region, can be RNA/DNA analogs comprising modified nucleotides. [0079] In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises, from 5’ to 3’, the singlestranded overhang, the first region (the protected domain), the hairpin loop, and the second region (the protection domain) (see, for example, FIG. 2). The first region is linked to the 3’ of the singlestranded overhang and to the 5’ of the hairpin loop. The second region is linked to the 3’ of the hairpin loop. [0080] In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises from, 3’ to 5’, the singlestranded overhang, the first region (the protected domain), the hairpin loop region, and the second region (the protection domain) (see, for example, FIG. 2). The first region is linked to the 5’ of the single-stranded overhang on one terminus and to the 3’ region of the hairpin loop on the other terminus. The second region is linked to the 5’ of the hairpin loop. [0081] FIG. 3 illustrates a schematic representation of two non-limiting exemplary stem-loop antisense oligonucleotides with different chemical modifications. One exemplary implementation of the stem -loop ASO (Example 1) acts through RNase H mediated degradation. The first domain complementarily bound to the protection domain is a DNA domain protected within the duplex for reduced toxicity and non-specific binding and improved stability. The phosphorothioate backbone modifications are added in both regions in the stem to improve nuclease resistance. The phosphorothioate backbone modification in the middle of the protection domain can further prevent cleavage of the protection domain by RNase H. Another exemplary implementation of the stem-loop ASO (Example 2) acts through splicing modulation. Therefore, phosphorothioate backbone modification in the protected domain is not needed and DNA bases are not used in the protected domain. [0082] In some embodiments, the stem-loop antisense oligonucleotides herein described can comprise a sequence selected from the sequences in Tables 1-11. For example, the stem-loop antisense oligonucleotides can have a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1-94 or a variant thereof having one, two or three mismatches in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-94. In some embodiments, the stem-loop antisense oligonucleotides can have a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1-68 or a variant thereof having one, two or three mismatches in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-68. In some embodiments, the stem-loop antisense oligonucleotides can have a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 69-80 or a variant thereof having one, two or three mismatches in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 69-80. In some embodiments, the stem-loop antisense oligonucleotides can have a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 81-94 or a variant thereof having one, two or three mismatches in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 81-94. [0083] The oligonucleotides herein described can be synthesized using standard methods for oligonucleotide synthesis well-known in the art including, for example, Oligonucleotide Synthesis by Herdewijin, Piet (2005) and Modified oligonucleotides: Synthesis and Strategy for Users, by Verma and Eckstein, Annul Rev. Biochem. (1998): 67:99-134, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The synthesized oligonucleotide can be allowed to form its secondary structure under a desirable physiological condition as will be apparent to a skilled artisan. The formed secondary structure can be tested using standard methods known in the art such as chemical mapping, NMR, or computational simulations. The oligonucleotides can be further modified, according to the test result, by introducing or removing chemical modifications, mismatches, and/or terminal moieties, as necessary, until the desired structure or activity is obtained. Single-stranded overhang [0084] The stem-loop ASO comprises a single-stranded overhang. The term “overhang” as used herein refers to a stretch of unpaired nucleotides that protrudes at one of the ends of a double-stranded polynucleotide (e.g., a double-stranded stem). An overhang can be on either the 3’ terminus of the strand (3’ overhang) or at the 5’ terminus of the strand (5’ overhang). The overhang of the antisense oligonucleotide is not complementary to the protection domain and is capable of binding to a target nucleic acid, thereby initiating a toehold mediated strand displacement and causing the displacement of the protected domain from the protection domain. [0085] The length of the overhang can vary in different embodiments. In some embodiments, the length of the overhang can be 6-14 nucleotides. For example, the overhang in the stem-loop ASO can comprise 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the overhang of a stem-loop ASO is about 6-12 nucleotides (e.g., 6, 8, 10 or 12) in length. In some embodiments, the overhang of the stem-loop ASO is at least 8 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the overhang of the stem-loop ASO is about 8 nucleotides in length. [0086] In some embodiments, the single-stranded overhang comprises one or more chemical modifications including backbone modification, ribose modification (in the sugar portion) and/or base modification. The overhang can comprise at least one phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage. For example, the percentage of phosphorothioate intemucleoside linkages in the overhang is about, at least, or at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95%, or a number or a range between any two of these values. In some embodiments, all internucleoside linkages in the singlestranded overhang are phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. In some embodiments, the singlestranded overhang comprises at least one locked nucleic acid or analogue thereof. In some embodiments, about 10%-50% of the nucleotides in the single-stranded overhang are locked nucleic acid or analogues thereof. In some embodiments, the one or two nucleotides adjacent to a 3’ or 5’ terminus of the overhang are locked nucleic acid or analogue thereof. [0087] The single-stranded overhang can comprise 2’-O-methyl nucleoside. For example, the single-stranded overhang can comprise one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or more 2’-O-methyl nucleosides. In some embodiments, the percentage of 2’-O-methyl nucleoside in the overhang can be, be about, be at least, be at least about, be at most, or be at most about 10%-70%. In some embodiments, the single-stranded overhang comprises at least one deoxyribonucleotide. Double-stranded stem [0088] The double-stranded stem in the stem-loop ASO comprises a first region (a protected domain), i.e., a section in the ASO domain located between the single-stranded overhang and the hairpin loop, complementarily bound to a second region (a protection domain). In some embodiments, the protected domain is perfectly complementary to the protection domain. In some embodiments, the complementarity is imperfect with one or more mismatches between the two domains. The protected domain is adjacent to the single-stranded overhang. The protected domain can be located at the 3’ or 5’ end of the single-stranded overhang. The protected domain can be directly linked to the single-stranded overhang and/or the hairpin loop. In some embodiments, the protection domain does not have an overhang. [0089] The length of the double-stranded stem region can vary in different embodiments. In some embodiments, the double-stranded stem region is 4-20 nucleotides in length. The first region (the protected domain) and the second region (the protection domain) can be the same in length. In some embodiments, the protected domain is 4-20 nucleotides in length. For example, the protected domain can be 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 linked nucleosides in length. In some embodiments, the protected domain is about 6-16 (e.g., 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16) nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the protection domain is 4-20 nucleotides in length. For example, the protection domain can be 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 linked nucleosides in length. In some embodiments, the protection domain is about 6-16 (e.g., 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16) nucleotides in length. [0090] The protected domain of the double-stranded stem and the single-stranded overhang together form an ASO domain. The length of the ASO domain can vary in different embodiments. In some embodiments, the ASO domain is about 8-35 nucleotides in length. The ASO domain comprises a sequence complementary to a target nucleic acid having a about 6-28 nucleotides in length. One skilled in the art would recognize that some mismatches between the ASO domain and the target nucleic acid can be tolerated without eliminating the activity of the ASO. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the ASO domain can comprise up to about 20% mismatches, e.g., about, at most, or at most about 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% mismatches. The ASO domain can comprises a sequence about, at least, or at least about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% complementary to a target nucleic acid or a portion thereof. In some embodiments, incorporation of nucleotide affinity modifications can allow for a greater number of mismatches compared to unmodified nucleotides. Therefore, certain oligonucleotide sequences can be more tolerant to mismatches than other oligonucleotide sequences. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine an appropriate number of mismatches between an ASO and a target nucleic acid, such as by determining melting temperature. In some embodiments, the protection domain does not comprises a sequence complementary to a target nucleic acid or is not capable of binding to a target nucleic acid. [0091] In some embodiments, the ASO domain comprises a sequence complementary to a nucleic acid sequence within a microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) transcript. For example, in some embodiments, the ASO domain can comprise a sequence complementary to a nucleic acid sequence within a transcript of MAPT gene having SEQ ID NO: 175. In some embodiments, the ASO domain can hybridize to a nucleic acid sequence within a transcript of MAPT gene having SEQ ID NO: 175. In some embodiments, the ASO domain comprises a nucleotide sequence having at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%;, at least about 99%, or 100% complementarity to a region within a transcript of MAPT gene having SEQ ID NO: 175.

In some embodiments, the ASO domain comprises a nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 162. [0093] In some embodiments, the ASO domain comprises a nucleic acid sequence ATTtCcaaattcacTtTtAC (SEQ ID NO: 176), wherein each upper case letter is a beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleoside, and wherein each lower case letter is a DNA nucleoside. [0094] In some embodiments, the ASO domain comprises a nucleic acid sequence ATtTCcaaattcactTTtAC (SEQ ID NO: 177), wherein each upper case letter is a beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleoside, and wherein each lower case letter is a DNA nucleoside.

In some embodiments, the protection domain can comprise at least one locked nucleic acid or analogue thereof. For example, the percentage of locked nucleic acid in the protection domain is about, at most, or at most about 5%, 10%, 15% or 20%. In some embodiments, the protection domain does not comprise a locked nucleic acid. The lack of locked nucleic acids in the protection domain can attenuate cytotoxicity induced by locked nucleic acids. The protection domain can comprise 2’-O-methyl nucleoside.

In some embodiments, all the nucleosides in the protection domain are 2’-O-methyl nucleosides. [0097] The protection domain can comprise a delivery ligand or a terminal moiety. The delivery ligand can be attached to the middle, the 5’ terminus, or 3’ terminus of the protection domain. The terminal moiety and/or delivery ligand can be any of the terminal moiety and/or delivery ligand described herein.

In some embodiments, the hairpin loop comprises one locked nucleic acid and three 2’- O-methyl nucleotides. In some embodiments, one to three nucleotides in the hairpin loop adjacent to the protection domain are ribonucleotides, optionally the ribonucleotides are modified nucleotides, optionally, the modified ribonucleotides comprises 2’-O-methyl modification. In some embodiments, one to three nucleotides (one, two or three) in the hairpin loop adjacent to the protected domain are locked nucleic acid or analogues thereof, deoxyribonucleotides, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the hairpin loop comprises one, two or three deoxy rib onucl eoti des . [0100] The hairpin loop can comprise a sequence complementary to a target nucleic acid. For example, the hairpin loop can comprise one, two, three or four nucleotides complementary to a portion in the target nucleic acid. In some embodiments, the hairpin loop does not comprise a sequence complementary to a target nucleic acid. Activation of a stem-loop ASO [0101] The stem-loop antisense oligonucleotide described herein can be conditionally activated to switch from an inactivated state or configuration to an activated state or configuration to act on (e g., degrade or modulate) a specific target nuclei acid having a sequence complementarity to a sequence in the single-stranded overhang of the ASO. [0102] In the inactivated configuration (hairpin structure), the stem region in the ASO blocks the antisense activity of the ASO domain, keeping it in the switched off state. In the event that a target nucleic acid complementary to the single-stranded overhang is present, such as upon cellular uptake of the ASO, the target nucleic acid can activate the ASO by inducing separation of the ASO domain from the protection via toehold mediated strand displacement (FIG. 4). The displacement can start from the toehold formed at the 3’ or 5’ terminus of the oligonucleotide through a complementary binding between the target nucleic acid and the single-stranded overhang. The toehold-mediated strand displacement can dissociate the protected domain in the ASO domain from the protection domain to result in a potent, functional ASO strand and switch on the antisense activity of the antisense oligonucleotide. After the release of the ASO domain, the anchor domain (hairpin) can stabilize the base-pairing between the target nucleic acid and the ASO domain and prevents the protection domain from reforming into a hairpin. Following the degradation of the target nucleic acid, the antisense oligonucleotide can reform its original hairpin conformation until the engagement with a next target nucleic acid in another cycle of activity (FIG. 4). [0103] As used herein, the term “antisense activity” refers to any detectable and/or measurable activity attributable to the hybridization of an antisense oligonucleotide to its target nucleic acid. Such detection and or measuring can be direct or indirect. For example, in some embodiments, antisense activity is assessed by detecting and/or measuring the amount of target protein. In some embodiments, antisense activity is assessed by detecting and/or measuring the amount of target nucleic acids and/or cleaved target nucleic acids and/or alternatively spliced target nucleic acids. [0104] The activated ASO can modulate protein expression of a target nucleic acid through several different mechanisms as will be recognized by a person skilled in the art. For example, in some embodiments, the activated ASO exerts an antisense effect/activity through RNase H mediated degradation, in which the ASO and the target RNA form ASO-RNA heteroduplexes that can be degraded by RNases in the cytoplasm. RNase H is a cellular endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. The DNA-like ASO can elicit RNase H, resulting in cleavage of the RNA target. In some embodiments, the activated ASO acts through RNase H-independent mechanisms such as steric blockage or splice modulation or splice switching based mechanism. Steric blocking ASOs can inhibit or activate translation through the binding to regulatory elements, e.g., upstream open reading frames. Activated ASOs can also induce the skipping of pseudoexons or block RNA-splicing factors from recognizing cryptic splice sites. ASOs can also sterically block the union of RNA-binding factors to repeat expansion regions of pathogenic mRNAs. Duplex oligonucleotide complex [0105] Provided herein also includes a duplex oligonucleotide complex for the delivery of an antisense oligonucleotide. The duplex oligonucleotide complex comprises an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) strand and an adapter oligonucleotide strand. The ASO strand comprises a first single-stranded overhang and a first domain and the adapter oligonucleotide strand comprises a second single- stranded overhang and a second domain. The first domain of the ASO strand base pairs with the second domain of the adapter oligonucleotide strand to form a double-stranded duplex structure. The first single-stranded overhang of the ASO strand is capable of binding to a target nucleic acid to cause toehold-mediated displacement of the first region from the second region, thereby releasing the ASO strand from the double-stranded duplex structure. One or more nucleotides in the ASO strand and/or in the adapter strand can be RNA/DNA analogs comprising modified nucleotides. [0106] As used herein, a “duplex” or “nucleic acid duplex” refers to a secondary structure formed by two single-stranded polynucleotides bound to each other through complementary binding. The nucleic acid duplex can form a helical structure, such as a doublestranded nucleic acid molecule, which is maintained largely by non-covalent bonding of base pairs between the two single-stranded polynucleotides and by base stacking interactions. [0107] FIG. 5 illustrates a schematic representation of a non-limiting exemplary duplex oligonucleotide complex. In the absence of a target nucleic acid or a detectable amount of the target nucleic acid, the duplex oligonucleotide complex herein described remains in an activated (OFF state) (see, for example, FIG. 5). A portion of the ASO strand and a portion of the adapter strand are bound to each other through complementary binding forming a duplex structure. The doublestranded duplex structure is able to block the antisense activity of the ASO strand and keep the ASO in the OFF state. The length of the double-stranded duplex region can vary in different embodiments. In some embodiments, the duplex region can be about 6-25 nucleotides in length. For example, the length of the duplex region can be 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or a range of any two of these values, nucleotides. In some embodiments, the length of the duplex region is about 10-20 (e.g., 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20) nucleotides. [0108] The ASO strand and the adapter strand each comprises a single-stranded overhang or toehold at 5’ or 3’ terminus of the strand. For example the overhang in the ASO strand can be located at the 3’ or 5’ of the ASO strand. Similarly, the overhang in the adapter strand can be located at the 3’ or 5’ of the adapter strand. The overhang in the ASO strand and the overhang in the adapter strand can have a same length or a different length. The length of the overhang can vary in different embodiments. For example, the overhang in the ASO strand can be about 2-15 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the overhang in the ASO strand is at least 8 nucleotides in length. Alternatively or in addition, the overhang in the adapter strand can be about 2-15 nucleotide in length, optionally the overhang in the adapter strand can be at least 8 nucleotides in length. [0109] The overhang in the ASO strand is capable of binding to a target nucleic acid, thereby initiating a toehold-mediated strand displacement of the first domain of the ASO strand from the second domain of the adapter strand. The displacement of the first domain from the second domain results in the release of the ASO strand from the double-stranded duplex structure, therefore the ASO strand no longer binds to the adapter strand, allowing the ASO strand to fully hybridize with the target nucleic acid. ASO strand [0110] The ASO strand comprises a single-stranded overhang (a first overhang) and a domain (a first domain) complementarily binding to a domain in the adapter domain (a second domain). The length of the ASO strand can vary in different embodiments. In some embodiments, the ASO strand is about 8-35 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the ASO strand is about 15-25 nucleotides in length. [0111] The single-stranded overhang can be on either the 3’ terminus of the ASO strand (3’ overhang) or at the 5’ terminus of the strand (5’ overhang). The length of the first overhang can be about 2-15 nucleotides in length. For example, the first overhang can be about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or a range of any two of these values, nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the first overhang is at least 8 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the overhang of the ASO strand is about 8 nucleotides in length. The length of the first domain can vary in different embodiments. In some embodiments, the first domain can be about 6-25 nucleotides in length. For example, the length of the first domain can be 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or a range of any two of these values, nucleotides. In some embodiments, the length of the first domain is about 10-20 (e.g., 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20) nucleotides. [0112] The ASO strand comprises a sequence complementary to a target nucleic acid. The sequence complementary to a target nucleic acid can be about 6-28 nucleotides in length One skilled in the art would recognize that some mismatches between the ASO strand and the target nucleic acid can be tolerated without eliminating the activity of the ASO. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the ASO strand can comprise up to about 20% mismatches, e.g., about, at most, or at most about 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% mismatches. The ASO strand can comprises a sequence about, at least, or at least about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% complementary to a target nucleic acid or a portion thereof. In some embodiments, incorporation of nucleotide affinity modifications can allow for a greater number of mismatches compared to unmodified nucleotides. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine an appropriate number of mismatches between an ASO strand and a target nucleic acid, such as by determining melting temperature. [0113] In some embodiments, the ASO strand comprises one or more chemical modifications including backbone modification, ribose modification (in the sugar portion) and/or base modification. In some embodiments, the ASO strand alone is incompatible with gymnosis delivery. Gymnosis is a process of the delivery of antisense oligonucleotides to cells in the absence of any delivery carrier or vehicle or molecular conjugation. In some embodiments, the use of an adapter strand and the resulting duplex complex can allow an effective gymnotic delivery of an ASO strand that is otherwise incompatible with gymnosis. In some embodiments, the duplex oligonucleotide complex described herein can reduce the ASO dose required for the gymnosis process to take place. [0114] In some embodiments, the ASO strand alone is incompatible with lipid-based nucleic acid transfection approaches. Standard lipid-based nucleic acid transfection carriers rely on ionic interaction with a charged backbone and are not effective when the ASO is non-ionic or uncharged. In some embodiments, the ASO strand is hydrophobic, non-ionic or uncharged, and the duplex oligonucleotide complex described herein allows delivery of the ASO strand via a lipid- based delivery system such as lipid nanoparticles or liposomes. [0115] In some embodiments, the ASO strand is neutral, hydrophobic, non-ionic or uncharged. In some embodiments, the ASO strand does not comprise a charged phosphate linkage and/or ribose sugar backbone. For example, in some embodiments, the ASO strand does not comprise a phosphodiester backbone linkage, a phosphorothioate backbone linkage or both. The phosphodiester backbone linkage can be substituted with a neutral backbone linkage such as a phosphorodiamidate linkage or a peptide bond. [0116] In some embodiments, the ASO strand comprises a morpholino oligomer. A morpholino, also known as morpholino oligomer or as a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) is a type of oligomer molecule with a molecular structure containing DNA bases attached to a backbone of methylenemorpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups. Morpholinos block access of other molecules to small (about 25 bases) specific sequences of the base-pairing surfaces of ribonucleic acid. In some embodiments, antisense oligonucleotides comprising morpholinos do not trigger the degradation of their target RNA molecules. Instead, morpholinos can bind to complementary RNA sequence and sterically inhibit molecules that may otherwise interact with the RNA. Morpholinos can modulate gene expression by blocking mRNA translation or by modifying pre-mRNA splicing (e.g., by targeting the oligo to a splice junction or regulatory site, sterically blocking binding of snRNPs or other splice factors), or blocking other functional sites on RNA depending on the morpholino’ s base sequence. Morpholinos can also be used to block microRNA maturation and microRNA targets, block ribozyme activity and induce frameshifts. Exemplary PMOs include, but are not limited to, golodirsen, casimersen, eteplirsen and viltolarsen. [0117] In some embodiments, the ASO strand is a peptide nuclei acid. Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are oligonucleotide analogues in which the sugar-phosphate backbone is replaced by a pseudopeptide skeleton. PNAs can bind DNA and RNA with high specificity and selectivity, thus forming PNA-RNA and PNA-DNA hybrids more stable than the corresponding nucleic acid complexes. PNAs are also resistant to degradation by nucleases or proteases and stable over a range of pH values. [0118] In some embodiments, the ASO strand does not comprise a locked nucleic acid. In some embodiments, the ASO strand does not comprise a locked nucleic acid at the 3’ and/or 5’ terminus of the ASO strand. Adapter strand [0119] The adapter strand comprises a single-stranded overhang (a second overhang) and a domain (a second domain) complementarily binding to a domain in the ASO strand (a first domain). The length of the adapter strand can vary in different embodiments. In some embodiments, the adapter strand is about 8-35 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the adapter strand is about 15-25 nucleotides in length. [0120] The single-stranded overhang can be on either the 3’ terminus of the adapter strand (3’ overhang) or at the 5’ terminus of the strand (5’ overhang). The length of the overhang can be about 2-15 nucleotides in length. For example, the overhang can be about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or a range of any two of these values, nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the overhang is at least 8 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the overhang of the adapter strand is about 8 nucleotides in length. The single-stranded overhang in the adapter strand is not capable of binding to a target nucleic acid or does not comprise a sequence complementary to a target nucleic acid. [0121] The length of the second domain can vary in different embodiments. In some embodiments, the second domain can be about 6-25 nucleotides in length. For example, the length of the second domain can be 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or a range of any two of these values, nucleotides. In some embodiments, the length of the second domain is about 10-20 (e.g., 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20) nucleotides. [0122] The adapter strand can comprise at least one chemical modifications including backbone modification, ribose modification (in the sugar portion) and/or base modification. The single-stranded overhang in the adapter strand can comprise one or more chemical modifications. The single-stranded overhang in the adapter strand can comprise at least one phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage. For example, the percentage of phosphorothioate intemucleoside linkages in the overhang is about, at least, at least about, at most, or at most about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or a number or a range between any two of these values. In some embodiments, all of the internucleoside linkages in the overhang are phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. The overhang can comprise at least one 2’-O-methyl nucleotide. For example, the percentage of 2’-O- methyl nucleotides in the overhang is about, at least, at least about, at most, or at most about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or a number or a range between any two of these values. In some embodiments, all of the nucleotides in the overhang are 2’-O-methyl nucleotides. In some embodiments, the single-stranded overhang does not comprise a locked nucleic acid [0123] The second domain of the adapter strand can comprise one or more chemical modifications. The second domain of the adapter strand can comprise at least one phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage. The at least one phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage can be between the one to three nucleotides adjacent to the terminus of the adapter strand. In some embodiments, the second domain does not comprise a phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage. In some embodiments, about, at least, or at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% internucleoside linkages in the second domain are phosphodiester internucleoside linkages. In some embodiments, all of the internucleoside linkages in the second domain are phosphodiester internucleoside linkages. In some embodiments, all internucleoside linkages in the second domain are phosphodiester intemucleoside linkages except for the intemucleoside linkages between the two or three terminal nucleotides. In some embodiments, the intemucleoside linkages between the one to three nucleotides adjacent to the 3’ and/or 5’ of the adapter oligonucleotide strand are phosphorothioate intemucleoside linkages. [0124] The second domain can comprise at least one 2’-O-methyl nucleotide. For example, the percentage of 2’-O-methyl nucleotides in the second domain is about, at least, at least about, at most, or at most about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or a number or a range between any two of these values. In some embodiments, all of the nucleotides in the second domain are 2’- O-methyl nucleotides. In some embodiments, the second domain does not comprise a locked nucleic acid. In some embodiments, about, at least, at least about, at most, or at most about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% nucleotides in the adapter strand are 2’-O-methyl nucleotides. In some embodiments, all the nucleotides in the adapter strand are 2’-O-methyl nucleotides. [0125] The adapter strand can comprise a delivery ligand or a terminal moiety. The delivery ligand can be attached to the middle, the 5’ terminus, and/or 3’ terminus of the adapter strand. In some embodiments, the second single-stranded overhang in the adapter strand comprises a delivery ligand. The terminal moiety and/or delivery ligand can be any of the terminal moiety and/or delivery ligand described herein. For example, the terminal moiety can comprise a ligand, a fluorophore, an exonuclease, a fatty acid, a Cy3, an inverted dT attached to a tri-ethylene glycol, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the terminal moiety is a 5 ’-palmitic acid or a 3’ palmitic acid. [0126] In some embodiments, an adapter strand is designed to deliver a morpholino ASO such as golodirsen morpholino, casimersen morpholino or eteplirsen morpholino. In some embodiments, an adapter strand can have a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 144, 146, 150, 152, 156 or 158 or a variant thereof having one, two or three mismatches in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 144, 146, 150, 152, 156 or 158. Activation of a duplex oligonucleotide [0127] The duplex oligonucleotide complex described herein can be conditionally activated to switch from an inactivated state or configuration to an activated state or configuration to act on a specific target nuclei acid having a sequence complementarity to a sequence in the ASO strand. [0128] In the inactivated configuration (duplex structure), the duplex structure blocks the antisense activity of the ASO strand, keeping it in the switched off state. In the event that a target nucleic acid complementary to the single-stranded overhang of the ASO strand is present, such as upon cellular uptake of the duplex oligo complex, the target nucleic acid can activate the ASO by inducing separation of the ASO strand from the adapter strand via toehold mediated strand displacement (FIG. 7). The displacement can start from the toehold formed at the 3’ or 5’ terminus of the ASO strand through a complementary binding between the target nucleic acid and the singlestranded overhang The toehold-mediated strand displacement can dissociate the first domain of the ASO strand from the second domain of the adapter strand to result in a potent, functional ASO strand and switch on the antisense activity of the ASO strand. After the ASO strand fully hybridizes with the target nucleic acid, the adapter strand can be released and degraded by endogenous mechanism. [0129] The activated ASO can modulate protein expression of a target nucleic acid through several different mechanisms. In some embodiments wherein the ASO strand comprises morpholinos or peptide nucleic acids, the activated ASO can act through RNase H-independent mechanisms such as steric blockers or splice-switching oligonucleotides for exon-skipping. Modulation of a target nucleic acid [0130] Upon activation, the antisense oligonucleotides herein described can inhibit a target nucleic acid in target cells, therefore resulting in a reduction or loss of expression of the target nucleic acid in the target cells. The target cells are cells associated or related to a disease or disorder. The term “associated to” “related to” as used herein refers to a relation between the cells and the disease or condition such that the occurrence of a disease or condition is accompanied by the occurrence of the target cells, which includes but is not limited to a cause-effect relation and sign/symptoms-disease relation. The target cells used herein typically have a detectable amount of a target nucleic acid. [0131] In some embodiments, the expression of a target nucleic acid in target cells is inhibited about, at least, at least about, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 31%, 32%, 33%, 34%, 35%, 36%, 37%, 38%, 39%, 40%, 41%, 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%, 49%, 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100%, or a number or a range between any of these values. [0132] As used herein, inhibition of gene expression refers to the absence or observable decrease in the level of protein and/or mRNA product from a target gene in target cells. The degree of inhibition can be evaluated by examination of the expression level of the target gene as demonstrated in the examples. [0133] In some embodiments, gene expression and/or the inhibition of target gene expression can be determined by use of a reporter or drug resistance gene whose protein product is easily assayed. Exemplary reporter genes include, but no limiting to, acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS), alkaline phosphatase (AP), beta galactosidase (LacZ), beta glucoronidase (GUS), chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), green fluorescent protein (GFP), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), luciferase (Luc), nopaline synthase (NOS), octopine synthase (OCS), and derivatives thereof. Multiple selectable markers are available that confer resistance to ampicillin, bleomycin, chloramphenicol, gentarnycin, hygromycin, kanamycin, lincomycin, methotrexate, phosphinothricin, puromycin, and tetracyclin. Quantitation of the amount of gene expression allows one to determine a degree of inhibition as compared to cells not treated with the antisense oligonucleotide or treated with a negative or positive control. Various biochemical techniques may be employed as will be apparent to a skilled artisan such as RNA solution hybridization, nuclease protection, Northern hybridization, reverse transcription, gene expression monitoring with a microarray, antibody binding, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting, radioimmunoassay (RIA), other immunoassays, and fluorescence activated cell analysis (FACS). [0134] In some embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotides disclosed herein exhibit improved switching performance and reduced off-target effects. The antisense oligonucleotides disclosed herein can have a reduced unwanted antisense activity when the antisense oligonucleotides are in an inactivated state (switched off) and an enhanced antisense activity when the antisense oligonucleotides are activated upon detection of a target nucleic acid. [0135] In some embodiments, the expression of a target nucleic acid in non-target cells (e g cells not having a target nucleic acid) is inhibited about, at most, or at most about 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 31%, 32%, 33%, 34%, 35%, 36%, 37%, 38%, 39%, 40%, 41%, 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%, 49%, 50%, or a number or a range between any of these values. Non-target cells can comprise cells of the subject other than target cells. Therefore, in some embodiments, non-target cells typically do not have a detectable amount of a target nucleic acid. [0136] In some embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotides herein described have an enhanced potency, thus capable of evoking an antisense activity at low concentrations. Nonspecific, off-target effects and toxicity (e.g. undesired proinflammatory responses) can be minimized by using low concentrations of the nucleic acid complexes. In some embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotides herein described have reduced off-target interactions with cellular proteins, reduced non-specific degradation of long pre-mRNA transcripts, reduced non-specific degradation of mRNA and other non-specific, non-selective protein binding and base-pairing interactions, thus leading to reduced toxicity compared to other antisense compounds such as compounds in gapmer or mixmer configurations, while maintaining or improving potency and duration of activity. In some embodiments, the binding efficiency between the antisense oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid can be increased by reducing unintended protein binding or binding to non-target oligonucleotides. Without being bound to any theory, it is believed that the stem-loop structure of the antisense oligonucleotides herein described can greatly reduce non-specific protein binding compared to single-stranded gapmers and mixmers. The toehold mediated strand displacement renders the binding with a target nucleic acid highly sequence-specific compared to single-stranded base-pairing and can be as fast or faster kinetically compared with binding of single-stranded antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., gapmers or mixmers). The single- stranded overhang in the antisense oligonucleotides herein described can induce sufficient uptake (e.g., gymnotic uptake), and the partial duplex construct can reduce non-specific protein binding, have longer duration of activity and increased stability in endo-lysosomal stability depot, and can also allow nuclear localization by avoiding nuclear export. [0137] In some embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotides described herein are characterized by comparable or improved potency and decreased toxicity as compared to gapmers and mixmers. For example, the cytotoxicity of the antisense oligonucleotides can be reduced by about, at least, or at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%. [0138] The concentration of the antisense oligonucleotides disclosed herein can vary in different embodiments. In some embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotides disclosed herein can be provided at a concentration of, about, at most, or at most about, 0.001 nM, 0.01 nM, 0.02 nM, 0.03 nM, 0.04 nM, 0.05 nM, 0.06 nM, 0.07 nM, 0.08 nM, 0.09 nM, 0.1 nM, 0.2 nM, 0.3 nM, 0.4 nM, 0.5 nM, 0.6 nM, 0.7 nM, 0.8 nM, 0.9 nM, 1.0 nM, 1.5 nM, 2.0 nM, 2.5 nM, 3.0 nM, 3.5 nM, 4.0 nM, 4.5 nM, 5.0 nM, 5.5 nM, 6.0 nM, 6.5 nM, 7.0 nM, 7.5 nM, 8.0 nM, 8.5 nM, 9.0 nM, 9.5 nM, 10 nM, 11 nM, 12 nM, 13 nM, 14 nM, 15 nM, 16 nM, 17 nM, 18 nM, 19 nM, 20 nM, 30 nM, 40 nM, 50 nM, or a number or a range between any two of these values. For example, the antisense oligonucleotides disclosed herein can be provided at a concentration between about 0.1-10 nM, preferably between about 1-10 nM. [0139] The antisense oligonucleotides herein described can allow lasting and consistently potent inhibition effects at low concentrations. For example, the nucleic acid complex can remain active for an extended period of time such as at least 12 hours, at least 24 hours, at least 36 hours, at least 48 hours, at least 60 hours, at least 72 hours, at least 84 hours, or at least 96 hours. In some embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotides can remain active for up to 30 days, up to 60 days, or up to 90 days. Target nucleic acid [0140] The antisense oligonucleotides herein describe comprise a sequence complementary to a target nucleic acid (e.g., RNA) in order to direct target-specific antisense activity. In some embodiments, the target RNA is a cellular RNA transcript. The target RNA can be an mRNA, an miRNA, a non-coding RNA, a viral RNA transcript, or a combination thereof. [0141] As used herein, a “target RNA” refers to a RNA whose expression is to be selectively inhibited or silenced through antisense mechanism. A target RNA can be a target gene comprising any cellular gene or gene fragment whose expression or activity is associated with a disease, a disorder or a condition. A target RNA can also be a foreign or exogenous RNA or RNA fragment whose expression or activity is associated with a disease, a disorder or a certain condition (e.g. a viral RNA transcript or a pro-viral gene).

In some embodiments, the target nucleic acid comprises a transcript of a gene selected from the group consisting of SMN1, SMN2, SCN1A, SCN8A, and CLN7. In some embodiments, the target nucleic acid comprises a MAPT gene or a MAPT mRNA. Chemical modification [0149] The antisense oligonucleotides herein described can comprise non-standard, modified nucleotides (nucleotide analog) or non-standard, modified nucleosides (nucleoside analog). [0150] The modifications are introduced to alter certain chemical properties of the nucleotide/nucleoside such as to increase thermodynamic stability, to increase resistance to nuclease degradation (e g. exonuclease resistant), and/or to increase binding specificity and minimize off- target effects. For example, thermodynamic stability can be determined based on measurement of melting temperature T m . A higher T m can be associated with a more thermodynamically stable chemical entity. The modification can comprise phosphonate modification, ribose modification (in the sugar portion), and/or base modification. FIG. 8 shows exemplary oligonucleotide modifications. [0151] In some embodiments, the modified nucleotide can comprise modifications to the sugar portion of the nucleotides. For example, the 2’ OH-group of a nucleotide can be replaced by a group selected from H, OR, R, F, Cl, Br, I, SH, SR, NH2, NHR, NR2, COOR, or OR, wherein R is substituted or unsubstituted Ci-Ce alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, etc. In some embodiments, the 2’ OH-group of a nucleotide or nucleoside is replaced by 2’ O-methyl group and the modified nucleotide or nucleoside is a 2’-O-methyl nucleotide or 2’-O-methyl nucleoside (2’-0Me). The 2’- O-methyl nucleotide or 2’ -O-methyl nucleoside can be 2\\'-O-methyladenosine, 2\\'-O- methylguanosine, 2\\'-O-methyluridine, or 2\\'-O-methylcytidine. In some embodiments, the 2’ OH- group of a nucleotide is replaced by fluorine (F), and the modified nucleotide or nucleoside is a 2’-F nucleotide or 2’-F nucleoside (2’ -deoxy-2’ -fluoro or 2’-F).The 2’-F nucleotide or 2’-F nucleoside can be 2\\'-F-adenosine, 2\\'-F -guanosine, 2\\'-F -uridine, or 2\\'-F-cytidine. [0152] In some embodiments, the modified nucleotide can comprise a modification in the phosphate group of the nucleotide, e.g. by substituting one or more of the oxygens of the phosphate group with sulfur or a methyl group. In some embodiments, one or more of the nonbridging oxygens of the phosphate group of a nucleotide is replaced by a sulfur. In some embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide herein described comprise one or more non-standard internucleoside linkage that is not a phosphodiester linkage. In some embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide herein described comprise one or more phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. In some embodiments, the introduction of one or more phosphorothioate linkage in the antisense oligonucleotide can endow the modified nucleotides with increased resistance to nucleases (e.g. endonucleases and/or exonucleases). [0153] In some embodiments, the modified nucleotide can comprise modifications to or substitution of the base portion of a nucleotide. For example, uridine and cytidine residues can be substituted with pseudouridine, 2-thiouridine, N6-methyladenosine, 5 -methy cytidine or other base analogs of uridine and cytidine residues. Adenosine can comprise modifications to Hoogsteen (e g. 7-triazolo-8-aza-7-deazaadenosines) and/or Watson-Crick face of adenosine (e.g. N2-alkyl-2- aminopurines). Examples of adenosine analogs also include Hoogsteen or Watson-Crick face- localized N-ethylpiperidine triazole-modified adenosine analogs, N-ethylpiperidine 7-EAA triazole (e.g. 7-EAA, 7-ethynyl-8-aza-7-deazaadenosine) and other adenosine analogs identifiable to a person skilled in the art. Cytosine may be substituted with any suitable cytosine analogs identifiable to a person skilled in the art. For example, cytosine can be substituted with 6’- phenylpyrrolocytosine (PhpC) which has shown comparable base pairing fidelity, thermal stability and high fluorescence. [0154] In some embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide herein described can comprise one or more locked nucleic acids or analogs thereof. Exemplary locked nucleic acid analogs include, for example, their corresponding locked analog phosphoramidites and other derivatives apparent to a skilled artisan. [0155] In some embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide herein described can comprise other chemically modified nucleotide or nucleoside with 2’-4’ bridging modifications. A 2’ -4’ bridging modification refers to the introduction of a bridge connecting the and 4\\' carbons of a nucleotide. The bridge can be a 2’-O, 4’-C methylene bridge (e.g. in LNA). The bridge can also be a 2’-O, 4’-C ethylene bridge (e.g. in ethyl en-bridged nucleic acids (ENA)) or any other chemical linkage identifiable to a person skilled in the art. [0156] In some embodiments, the introduction of LNA, analogues thereof, or other chemically modified nucleotides with 2’-4’ bridging modifications in the ASO herein described can enhance hybridization stability as well as mismatch discrimination. For example, an antisense oligonucleotide comprising LNA, analogues thereof, or other chemically modified nucleotides with 2’ -4’ bridging modifications can have an enhanced sensitivity to distinguish between matched and mismatched target nucleic acid strand. [0157] In some embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide described herein does not comprise a locked nucleic acid. The lack of locked nucleic acids in the antisense oligonucleotide can attenuate cytotoxicity induced by locked nucleic acids. [0158] In some embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide can comprise a chemical moiety linked to the 3’ and/or 5’ terminus of the strand. The terminal moiety can include one or more any suitable terminal linkers or modifications. For example, the terminal moiety can include a linker to link the oligonucleotide with another molecule or a particular surface (biotins, amino- modifiers, alkynes, thiol modifiers, azide, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, and cholesterol), a dye (e.g. fluorophore or a dark quencher), a fluorine modified ribose, a space (e g. C3 spacer, Spacer 9, Spacer 18, dSpacer, tri-ethylene glycol spacer, hexa-ethylene glycol spacer), moi eties and chemical modification involved in click chemistry (e.g. alkyne and azide moieties), and any linkers or terminal modifications that can be used to attach the 3\\' and 5\\' end to other chemical moieties such as antibodies, gold or other metallic nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimer nanoparticles, small molecules, single chain or branched fatty acids, peptides, proteins, aptamers, and other nucleic acid strands and nucleic acid nanostructures. The terminal moiety can serve as a label capable of detection or a blocker to protect a single-stranded nucleic acid from nuclease degradation. Additional linkers and terminal modification that can be attached to the terminus of the sensor nucleic acid strand are described in www.idtdna.com/pages/products/custom-dna-rna/oligo- modifications and www.glenresearch.com/browse/labels-and-modifiers, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. [0159] Additional modifications to the nucleotides and/or nucleosides can also be introduced to the antisense oligonucleotide herein described, such as modifications described in Hammond et al. (EMB0 Molecular Medicine 13:el3243), the content of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Pharmaceutical compositions and methods of administration Compositions [0160] Also provided herein include pharmaceutical compositions comprising the oligonucleotide as herein described, in combination with one or more compatible and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. [0161] The oligonucleotide herein described can be suitably formulated and introduced into cell environment by any means that allows for a sufficient portion of the constructs to enter the cells to induce gene silencing, if it occurs. [0162] The oligonucleotide can be admixed, encapsulated, conjugated, or associated with other molecules, molecule structures, mixtures of compounds or agent, or other formulations for assistance in uptake, distribution, and/or absorption during delivery. [0163] The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those agents, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. [0164] The term “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” as used herein refers to any suitable substance that provides a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, additive or diluent for administration of a compound(s) of interest to a subject. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipient can encompass substances referred to as pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, pharmaceutically acceptable additives, and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. [0165] The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” as used herein means a pharmaceutically-acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid fdler, diluent, excipient, solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting the subject chemical from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the subject. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2) starches, such as com starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth: (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; (12) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-free water; (17) isotonic saline; (18) Ringer\\'s solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) phosphate buffer solutions; and (21) other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations. [0166] In some embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier comprise a pharmaceutical acceptable salt. As used herein, a “pharmaceutical acceptable salt” includes a salt of an acid form of one of the components of the compositions herein described. These include organic or inorganic acid salts of the amines. Preferred acid salts are the hydrochlorides, acetates, salicylates, nitrates and phosphates. Other suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known to those skilled in the art and include basic salts of a variety of inorganic and organic acids. [0167] In some embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable salts to be used with the nucleic acid complex herein described include but are not limited to (1) salts formed with cations such as sodium, potassium, ammonium, magnesium, calcium, polyamines such as spermine and spermidine; (2) acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids, for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and the like; (3) salts formed with organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, citric acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, tannic acid, palmitic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p- toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalene disulfonic acid, polygalacturonic acid, and the like; and (4) salts formed from elemental anions such as chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Delivery [0168] Various delivery systems can be employed for delivering the nucleic acid complex herein described such as antibody conjugates, micelles, natural polysaccharides, peptides, synthetic cationic polymers, microparticles, lipid-based nanovectors among others. [0169] Delivery systems and the related excipients used for delivery of the oligonucleotide herein described can vary in different embodiments. Delivery systems can be selected based on the mode of administration utilized, types of formulations, target sites, and types of diseases or disorders to be treated to facilitate tissue penetration, cellular uptake and to prevent extravasation and endosomal escape. [0170] In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide can be formulated with one or more polymers to form a supramolecular complex containing the oligonucleotide and a multi-dimensional polymer network. The polymer can be linear or branched. The supramolecular complex can take any suitable form, and preferably, is in the form of particles. [0171] The oligonucleotide can be delivered via a lipid-mediated delivery system. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide can be encapsulated or associated with liposomes. For example, the oligonucleotide can be condensed with a polycationic condensing agent, suspended in a low-ionic strength aqueous medium and cationic liposomes formed of a cationic vesicle-forming lipid. [0172] As used herein, the term “liposomes” refers to lipid vesicles having an outer lipid shell, typically formed on one or more lipid bilayers, encapsulating an aqueous interior. In some embodiments, the liposomes are cationic liposomes composed of between about 20-80 mole percent of a cationic vesicle-forming lipid, with the remaining neutral vesicle-forming lipids and/or other components. As used herein, “vesicle-forming lipid” refers to any amphipathic lipid having hydrophobic and polar head group moieties and which by itself can form spontaneously into bilayer vesicles in water (e.g. phospholipids). A preferred vesicle-forming lipid is a diacyl-chain lipid, such as a phospholipid, whose acyl chains are typically between about 14-22 carbon atoms in length, and have varying degrees of unsaturation. [0173] A cationic vesicle-forming lipid is a vesicle-forming lipid whose polar head group with a net positive charge, at the operational pH, e.g., pH 4-9. Examples include phospholipids (e g., phosphatidylethanolamine), glycolipids (e g., cerebrosides and gangliosides having a cationic polar head-group), cholesterol amine and related cationic sterols (e.g., 1,2- diolelyloxy-3-(trimethylanuno) propane (DOTAP), N-[l-(2,3,-ditetradecyloxy)propyl]-N,N- dimethyl-N-hydroxyethylammonium bromide (DMRIE), N-[l-(2,3,-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N- dimethyl-N-hydroxy ethylammonium bromide (DORIE), N-[l-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N- trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA), 3P [N — (N\\',N \\'-dimethylaminoethane) carbamoyl] cholesterol (DC-Choi), and dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDAB)). [0174] A neutral vesicle-forming lipid is a vesicle-forming lipid having no net charge or including a small percentage of lipids having a negative charge in the polar head group. Examples of vesicle-forming lipids include phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and sphingomyelin (SM), and cholesterol, cholesterol derivatives, and other uncharged sterols. [0175] In some embodiments, the delivery systems used herein include, but are not limited to, nanoparticles (NPs), inorganic nanoparticles (e.g. silica NPs, gold NPs, Qdots, superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs, paramagnetic lanthanide ions) and other nanomaterials, nucleic acid lipid particles, polymeric nanoparticles, lipidoid nanoparticles (LNPs), chitosan and inulin nanoparticles, cyclodextrins nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, liposomes, micellar structures, capsids, polymers (e.g. polyethylenimine, anionic polymers), polymer matrices, hydrogels, dendrimers (e.g. poly-propylenimine (PPI) and poly-amidoamine (PAMAM)), nucleic acid nanostructure, exosomes, and GalN Ac-conjugated melittin-like peptides (NAG-MLPs). In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide can be formulated in buffer solutions such as phosphate buffered saline solutions. [0176] In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide herein described is delivered via lipidoid nanoparticles (LNPs). LNPs can comprise ionizable LNPs, cationic LNPs, and/or neutral LNPs. Ionizable LNPs are nearly uncharged during circulation but become protonated in a low pH environment, e.g., in the endosomes and lysosomes. Cationic LNPs exhibit a constitutive positive charge in blood circulation and in endosomes or lysosomes. Neutral LNPs are neutral, uncharged during circulation and in endosomes or lysosomes. [0177] The oligonucleotide herein described can be provided naked or conjugated to a ligand. Naked antisense oligonucleotides refer to a system that contains no delivery system that is associated with the oligonucleotide either covalently or noncovalently. When delivered in naked form, the naked oligonucleotide can be locally injected to a target site such as specific organs that are relatively closed off and contain few nucleases (e.g. eye). In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide herein described is delivered via gymnosis. [0178] In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide (e.g., antisense oligonucleotide) herein described can be attached to (e.g. fused or conjugated) a ligand to form ligand- oligonucleotide conjugates that can transport the oligonucleotide to desired tissues and cells by specific recognition and interactions between the ligand and the surface receptor of the cells or tissues. Common targeting ligands include carbohydrate, aptamers, antibodies or antibody fragments, peptides (e.g., cell-penetrating peptides, endosomolytic peptides), and small molecules (e.g., N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)), and others as will be apparent to a skilled artisan. [0179] In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide (e.g., antisense oligonucleotide) is conjugated to an aptamer. The term “aptamers” as used here refers to oligonucleotide or peptide molecules that bind a specific target with high affinity and specificity. In particular, nucleic acid aptamers can comprise, for example, nucleic acid species that have been engineered through repeated rounds of in vitro selection or equivalently, SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) to bind to various molecular targets such as small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, and even cells, tissues and organisms. Peptide aptamers are peptides that are designed to specifically bind to and interfere with protein-protein interactions inside cells. In particular, peptide aptamers can be derived, for example, according to a selection strategy that is derived from the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system. Aptamers are useful in biotechnological and therapeutic applications as they offer molecular recognition properties that rival that of the antibodies. [0180] In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide (e.g., antisense oligonucleotide) is conjugated to a small molecule. The term “small molecule” as used herein indicates an organic compound that is of synthetic or biological origin and that, although may include monomers and/or primary metabolites, is not a polymer. In some embodiments, small molecules can comprise molecules that are not protein or nucleic acids, which play a biological role that is endogenous (e.g., inhibition or activation of a target) or exogenous (e.g., cell signaling), which are used as a tool in molecular biology, or which are suitable as drugs in medicine. Small molecules can also have no relationship to natural biological molecules. Typically, small molecules have a molar mass lower than 1 kg/mol. Exemplary small molecules include secondary metabolites (e.g., actinomycin-D), certain antiviral drugs (such as amantadine and rimantadine), teratogens and carcinogens (such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), natural products (such as penicillin, morphine and paclitaxel) and additional molecules identifiable by a skilled artisan. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid complex herein described is conjugated to GalNAc.

[0182] In some embodiments, the delivery of the oligonucleotide (e.g., antisense oligonucleotide) herein described is such that at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or more of the target cells incorporate the oligonucleotide. In some embodiments, about 0.1-10 nM oligonucleotide is delivered to the target cells. Formulations [0183] Any suitable pharmaceutical formulations can be employed. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure may be specially formulated for administration in solid or liquid form, including those adapted for the following: (1) oral administration, for example, drenches (aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions), tablets, boluses, powders, granules, pastes; (2) parenteral administration, for example, by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection as, for example, a sterile solution or suspension: (3) topical application, for example, as a cream, ointment or spray applied to the skin; (4) intravaginally or intrarectally, for example, as a pessary, cream or foam; or (5) aerosol, for example, as an aqueous aerosol, liposomal preparation or solid particles containing the hydrogel composition. The pharmaceutical compositions can comprise one or more pharmaceutically- acceptable carriers. [0184] Formulations useful in the methods of the present disclosure include those suitable for oral, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal, aerosol and/or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated, the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient, which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the RNAi constructs which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 1% to about 99% of active ingredient, preferably from about 5% to about 70%, most preferably from about 10% to about 30%. [0185] Formulations suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of a respiration uncoupling agent as an active ingredient.

In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fdlers in soft and hard-fdled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. [0187] A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered peptide or peptidomimetic moistened with an inert liquid diluent. [0188] Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure may be determined by the methods of the present invention so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient, which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular subject, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the subject. [0189] Tablets, and other solid dosage forms, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions, which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions, which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients. [0190] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, com, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.

[0193] Formulations for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one or more respiration uncoupling agents with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate, and which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active agent. [0194] Formulations which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. [0195] Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of hydrogel compositions include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active component may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required. [0196] The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to a respiration uncoupling agent, excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof. [0197] Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions (e.g. eye drops) and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of the present disclosure. [01981 Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. [0199] These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. [0200] The pharmaceutical compositions herein described comprise a therapeutically- effective amount of the nucleic acid complexes. [0201] The phrase “therapeutically-effective amount” as used herein means that amount of nucleic acid complex disclosed herein which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect, e.g., cancer treatment, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. The therapeutically-effective amount also varies depending on the structure of the constructs, the route of administration utilized, the target sites, and the specific diseases or disorders to be treated as will be understood to a person skilled in the art. For example, if a given clinical treatment is considered effective when there is at least a 20% reduction in a measurable parameter associated with a disease or disorder, a therapeutically-effective amount of the constructs for the treatment of that disease or disorder is the amount necessary to achieve at least a 20% reduction in that measurable parameter. [0202] In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition herein described comprises the oligonucleotide in a suitable dosage sufficient to inhibit expression of the target gene in a subject (e.g. animal or human) being treated. In some embodiments, a suitable dosage of the oligonucleotide is in the range of 0.001 to 0.25 milligrams per kilogram body weight of the subject per day, or in the range of 0.01 to 20 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, or in the range of 0.01 to 10 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, or in the range of 0.10 to 5 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, or in the range of 0.1 to 2.5 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day. The pharmaceutical compositions comprising the oligonucleotide can be administered once daily, twice daily, three times daily or as needed or prescribed by a physician. The pharmaceutical composition herein described can also be provided in dosage units comprising two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day. The dosage unit can also be compounded for a single dose (e.g. using sustained or controlled release formulation) which can be sustainably released over several days in a controlled manner. [0203] As will be apparent to a skilled person, a suitable dosage unit of the pharmaceutical composition herein described can be estimated from data obtained from cell culture assays and further determined from data obtained in animal studies. For example, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. Suitable dosages of the compositions in combination with particular delivery systems can be selected in order to minimize toxicity, such as to minimize potential damage to untargeted cells and to reduce side effects. Administration [0204] As will be apparent to a skilled artisan, the oligonucleotide herein described and compositions thereof can be administrated to a subject using any suitable administration routes. The nucleic acid complexes and compositions thereof can be administered to a target site locally or systematically. [0205] The wording “local administration” or “topic administration” as used herein indicates any route of administration by which a composition is brought in contact with the body of the individual, so that the resulting composition location in the body is topic (limited to a specific tissue, organ or other body part where the imaging is desired). Exemplary local administration routes include injection into a particular tissue by a needle, gavage into the gastrointestinal tract, and spreading a solution containing hydrogel composition on a skin surface. [0206] The wording “systemic administration” as used herein indicates any route of administration by which a nucleic acid complex composition is brought in contact with the body of the individual, so that the resulting composition location in the body is systemic (i.e. non limited to a specific tissue, organ or other body part where the imaging is desired). Systemic administration includes enteral and parenteral administration. Enteral administration is a systemic route of administration where the substance is given via the digestive tract, and includes but is not limited to oral administration, administration by gastric feeding tube, administration by duodenal feeding tube, gastrostomy, enteral nutrition, and rectal administration. Parenteral administration is a systemic route of administration where the substance is given by route other than the digestive tract and includes but is not limited to intravenous administration, intra-arterial administration, intramuscular administration, subcutaneous administration, intradermal, administration, intraperitoneal administration, and intravesical infusion. [0207] In some embodiments, the methods of administration can comprise aerosol delivery, nasal delivery, vaginal delivery, rectal delivery, buccal delivery, ocular delivery, local delivery, topical delivery, intraci sternal delivery, intraperitoneal delivery, oral delivery, intramuscular injection, intravenous (IV) injection, subcutaneous (SC) injection, intranodal injection, intratumoral injection, intraperitoneal injection, and/or intradermal injection, or any combination thereof. The administration can also be site-specific injection (e.g. in the eye or the cerebral spinal fluid). [0208] In some embodiments, the administration can be Ex vivo transduction, cell injection, subcutaneous injection, intravenous injection, intrathecal delivery, intracerebroventricular injection, intradermal injection, intravitreal delivery, intratumoral delivery, or topical application (e g. topical eye drop). [0209] The methods of administration depends on the target site, the type of cells/tissues to be targeted at, and how the constructs are formulated. In some embodiments, lipid formulations can be administered to animals such as by intravenous, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal injection, or orally or by inhalation or other methods as known in the art. [0210] In some embodiments, the administration can be IV injection. In some embodiments, IV administration can be associated with ligand-conjugated oligonucleotide or oligonucleotide associated with a carrier herein described. In some embodiments, IV administration can be associated with naked oligonucleotide herein described via gymnosis. [0211] In some embodiments, the administration can be SC injection into the adipose tissue below the epidermis and dermis. In some embodiments, SC administration can be associated with ligand-conjugated oligonucleotide herein described. In some embodiments, SC administration can be associated with naked oligonucleotide herein described via gymnosis. In some embodiments, SC administration can render a slower release rate of the drugs into the systemic circulation and an entering into the lymphatic system, giving more time for recycling of cellular receptors that mediate uptake. In some embodiments, SC administration can be faster and easier to administer, reducing treatment burden. [0212] IV administration can, for example, be associated with nanoparticle and lipid nanoparticle formulated nucleic acid complex herein described. In some embodiments, IV administration can avoid first-pass metabolism in the liver and affords quick access to target tissue through the systemic circulation. Target sites [0213] The compositions herein described can be administered to any suitable target site. Target sites can be in vitro, in vivo or ex vivo. Exemplary target sites can include cells grown in an in vitro culture, including, primary mammalian, cells, immortalized cell lines, tumor cells, stem cells, and the like. Additional exemplary target sites include cells, tissues and organs in an ex vivo culture and cells, tissues, organs, or organs systems in vivo in a subject, for example, lungs, brain, kidney, liver, heart, the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system, the gastrointestinal system, the circulatory system, the immune system, the skeletal system, the sensory system, within a body of an individual and additional environments identifiable by a skilled person. [0214] The target site can comprise a site of disease or disorder or can be proximate to a site of a disease or disorder. The location of the one or more sites of a disease or disorder can be predetermined. The location of the one or more sites of a disease or disorder can be determined during the method (e.g., by an imaging-based method such as ultrasound or MRI). The target site can comprise a tissue, such as, for example, adrenal gland tissue, appendix tissue, bladder tissue, bone, bowel tissue, brain tissue, breast tissue, bronchi, coronal tissue, ear tissue, esophagus tissue, eye tissue, gall bladder tissue, genital tissue, heart tissue, hypothalamus tissue, kidney tissue, large intestine tissue, intestinal tissue, larynx tissue, liver tissue, lung tissue, lymph nodes, mouth tissue, nose tissue, pancreatic tissue, parathyroid gland tissue, pituitary gland tissue, prostate tissue, rectal tissue, salivary gland tissue, skeletal muscle tissue, skin tissue, small intestine tissue, spinal cord, spleen tissue, stomach tissue, thymus gland tissue, trachea tissue, thyroid tissue, ureter tissue, urethra tissue, soft and connective tissue, peritoneal tissue, blood vessel tissue and/or fat tissue. The tissue can be inflamed tissue. The tissue can comprise (i) grade I, grade II, grade III or grade IV cancerous tissue; (ii) metastatic cancerous tissue; (iii) mixed grade cancerous tissue; (iv) a subgrade cancerous tissue; (v) healthy or normal tissue; and/or (vi) cancerous or abnormal tissue. In some embodiments, upon administration, the nucleic acid complex and a composition thereof accumulates in vasculature of cancerous tissue. In some embodiments, the target site can comprise a solid tumor. [0215] In some embodiments, target sites where the oligonucleotide or compositions thereof can be administered can vary in different embodiments depending on the mode of administration utilized and the types of diseases or disordered to be treated. In some embodiments, the target sites can be related to ocular tissues, respiratory system, muscle, liver, central nerve system, solid tumors, hematopoietic system, skin, eye, placenta, bone, or other target sites in an individual as will be apparent to a skilled artisan. [0216] The term “individual” or “subject” or “patient” as used herein includes an animal and in particular higher animals and in particular vertebrates such as mammals and more particularly human beings. [0217] In some embodiments, the ratio of the concentration of the oligonucleotide at the subject’s target site to the concentration of the oligonucleotide outside the target site (e.g. in subject’s blood circulation, serum, or plasma) can vary. In some embodiments, the ratio of the concentration of the oligonucleotide at the subject’s target site to the concentration of the oligonucleotide outside the target site (e.g. in subject’s blood circulation, serum, or plasma) can be, or be about, be at least, be at least about, be at most, or be at most about, 1:1, 1.1:1, 1.2:1, 1.3:1, 1.4:1, 1.5:1, 1.6:1, 1.7:1, 1.8:1, 1.9:1, 2:1, 2.5:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, 11:1, 12:1, 13:1, 14:1, 15:1, 16:1, 17:1, 18:1, 19:1, 20:1, 21:1, 22:1, 23:1, 24:1, 25:1, 26:1, 27:1, 28:1, 29:1, 30:1, 31:1, 32:1, 33:1, 34:1, 35:1, 36:1, 37:1, 38:1, 39:1, 40:1, 41:1, 42:1, 43:1, 44:1, 45:1, 46:1, 47:1, 48:1, 49:1, 50:1, 51:1, 52:1, 53:1, 54:1, 55:1, 56:1, 57:1, 58:1, 59:1, 60:1, 61:1, 62:1, 63:1, 64:1, 65:1, 66:1, 67:1, 68:1, 69:1, 70:1, 71:1, 72:1, 73:1, 74:1, 75:1, 76:1, 77:1, 78:1, 79:1, 80:1, 81:1, 82:1, 83:1, 84:1, 85:1, 86:1, 87:1, 88:1, 89:1, 90:1, 91:1, 92:1, 93:1, 94:1, 95:1, 96:1, 97:1, 98:1, 99:1, 100:1, 200:1, 300:1, 400:1, 500:1, 600:1, 700:1, 800:1, 900:1, 1000:1, 2000:1, 3000:1, 4000:1, 5000:1, 6000:1, 7000:1, 8000:1, 9000:1, 10000:1, or a number or a range between any two of the values. [0218] The target site can comprise target cells. The target cells can be tumor cells (e.g. solid tumor cells). In some embodiments, the administration of the oligonucleotide and/or compositions herein described to a target site of the subject results in the death of at least about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about 100%, or a number or a range between any two of these values, of the target cells. The ratio of target cell death to non-target cell death after administration of the oligonucleotide and/or compositions can be at least about 2:1. In some embodiments, the ratio of target cell death to non-target cell death after administration of the oligonucleotide and/or compositions can be, or be about, or be at least, or be at least about, or be at most, or be at most about, 1:1, 1.1:1, 1.2:1, 1.3:1, 1.4:1, 1.5:1, 1.6:1, 1.7:1, 1.8:1, 1.9:1, 2:1, 2.5:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, 11:1, 12:1, 13:1, 14:1, 15:1, 16:1, 17:1, 18:1, 19:1, 20:1, 21:1, 22:1, 23:1, 24:1, 25:1, 26:1, 27:1, 28:1, 29:1, 30:1, 31:1, 32:1, 33:1, 34:1, 35:1, 36:1, 37:1, 38:1, 39:1, 40:1, 41:1, 42:1, 43:1, 44:1, 45:1, 46:1, 47:1, 48:1, 49:1, 50:1, 51:1, 52:1, 53:1, 54:1, 55:1, 56:1, 57:1, 58:1, 59:1, 60:1, 61:1, 62:1, 63:1, 64:1, 65:1, 66:1, 67:1, 68:1, 69:1, 70:1, 71:1, 72:1, 73:1, 74:1, 75:1, 76:1, 77:1, 78:1, 79:1, 80:1, 81:1, 82:1, 83:1, 84:1, 85:1, 86:1, 87:1, 88:1, 89:1, 90:1, 91:1, 92:1, 93:1, 94:1, 95:1, 96:1, 97:1, 98:1, 99:1, 100:1, 200:1, 300:1, 400:1, 500:1, 600:1, 700:1, 800:1, 900:1, 1000:1, 2000:1, 3000:1, 4000:1, 5000:1, 6000:1, 7000:1, 8000:1, 9000:1, 10000:1, or a number or a range between any two of the values. Methods of modulating a target nucleic acid [0219] Also provided herein is a method of modulating a target nucleic acid using the oligonucleotides or a composition thereof herein described. In some embodiments, the method comprises contacting a cell comprising a target nucleic acid with a stem-loop oligonucleotide described herein. Upon detection of the target nuclei acid, the single-stranded overhang can bind to the target nucleic acid to cause displacement of the first region (protected domain) from the second region (protection domain) and binding of the first region to the target nucleic acid, thereby modulating the target nucleic acid. [0220] In some embodiments, the method comprises contacting a cell with a duplex oligonucleotide complex described herein. The first single-stranded overhang in the antisense oligonucleotide strand binds to a target nucleotide in the cell to cause displacement of the first domain in the antisense oligonucleotide strand from the second domain in the adapter strand, thereby releasing the antisense oligonucleotide strand from the double-stranded duplex structure. [0221] Contacting the cells with the oligonucleotide can be performed with cells in vitro, in vivo or ex vivo. For example, the cells can be cells grown in an in vitro culture, including, primary mammalian, cells, immortalized cell lines, tumor cells, neuronal cells, stem cells, and the like. The cells can comprise cells, tissues and organs in an ex vivo culture and cells, tissues, organs, or organs systems in vivo in a subject, for example, lungs, brain, kidney, liver, heart, the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system, the gastrointestinal system, the circulatory system, the immune system, the skeletal system, the sensory system, within a body of an individual and additional environments identifiable by a skilled person. The cell can be a disease cell or a cell of disorder. The cell can be a cancer cell. The cell can be a neuronal cell. Contacting the cell with the oligonucleotide can occur can also occur in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo e.g., in the body of a subject. [0222] In some embodiments, a method disclosed herein can be used to inhibit or reduce the expression or transcription of a target gene. For example, the method disclosed herein can be used to down-regulate expression of the MAPT mRNA in a subject (e.g., in a human cell, particularly in a neuronal cell). Accordingly, provided herein includes a method of inhibiting or reducing Tau protein expression in a cell. The method can comprise contacting a cell expressing Tau protein with a stem-loop oligonucleotide described herein or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the stem-loop oligonucleotide, thereby inhibiting or reducing the Tau protein expression. The stem-loop oligonucleotide can comprises an ASO domain having a sequence complementary to a nucleic acid sequence within the MAPT mRNA (e.g., a mRNA transcript of SEQ ID NO: 175). In some embodiments, the stem-loop oligonucleotide can comprise a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1-94 or a variant thereof having one, two or three mismatches in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-94. In some embodiments, the stem-loop oligonucleotide can comprise a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1-68 or a variant thereof having one, two or three mismatches in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-68. Methods of treating a disease or disorder [0223] Also provided herein is a method of treating a disease or a condition using the oligonucleotides or a composition thereof herein described. The method can comprise administering the oligonucleotide described herein to a subject in need thereof. For example, upon the detection of a target nucleic acid, the single-stranded overhang in a stem-loop antisense oligonucleotide can bind to a target nucleic acid to cause displacement of the first region from the second region and binding of the first region to the target nucleic acid, thereby modulating the activity of the target nucleic acid or protein expression from the target nucleic acid in the subject to treat the disease or condition. In another example, upon the detection of a target nucleic acid, the first single-stranded overhang of the antisense oligonucleotide strand in the duplex oligonucleotide complex can bind to the target nucleic acid to cause displacement of the first domain from the second domain, thereby releasing the antisense oligonucleotide strand from the double-stranded duplex structure. The released antisense oligonucleotide strand is therefore activated and can modulate the activity of the target nucleic acid or protein expression from the target nucleic acid in the subject to treat the disease or condition. [0224] The term “condition” as used herein indicates a physical status of the body of an individual (as a whole or as one or more of its parts), that does not conform to a standard physical status associated with a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being for the individual. Conditions herein described include but are not limited disorders and diseases wherein the term “disorder” indicates a condition of the living individual that is associated to a functional abnormality of the body or of any of its parts, and the term “disease” indicates a condition of the living individual that impairs normal functioning of the body or of any of its parts and is typically manifested by distinguishing signs and symptoms. [0225] Various diseases and disorders can be treated with the oligonucleotides and compositions provided herein.

[0226] In some embodiments, the disease or disorder can be a genetic disorder. A genetic disorder is a disease caused in a whole or in part by a change in the DNA sequence away from the normal sequence. Genetic disorders can be caused by a mutation in one gene (monogenic disorder), by mutations in multiple genes (multifactorial inheritance disorders), by a combination of gene mutations and environmental factors, or by damage to chromosomes. In some embodiments, the genetic disorder is caused by a mutation of the dystrophin gene. In some embodiments, the disease or disorder is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In some embodiments, the genetic disorder is associated with mutations or variations in SMN1, SMN2, SCN1A, SCN8A, or CLN7. In some embodiments, the disease or disorder is spinal muscular atrophy, Batten’s disease, Dravet syndrome, or SCN8A encephalopathy. [0227] In some embodiments, the disease or disorder can be a cancer. The cancer can be a solid tumor, a liquid tumor, or a combination thereof. The nucleic acid complex herein described or a composition thereof can be administered to the cells, tissues and/or organs comprising a tumor using any suitable administration route.

EXAMPLES [0234] Some aspects of the embodiments discussed above are disclosed in further detail in the following examples, which are not in any way intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure. Example 1 Antisense activity of exemplary stem-loop antisense oligonucleotides [0235] This example demonstrates the antisense activity of various stem-loop antisense oligonucleotide constructs with different designs, including 3’ toehold, 5’ toehold, partially modified ASO domain, and 3’ or 5’ palmitic acids. The sequences of various oligonucleotide constructs evaluated in this example are provided in Tables 1-11 in the Sequence section. FIG. 9 illustrates the naming convention for the sequences shown in the sequence tables. [0236] ASO microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) target sequences were cloned into the 3’ UTR of the pGL4.13[luc2/SV40] vector (Promega), a dual luciferase reporter plasmid, using standard molecular biology methods. Two variants of the MAPT ASO1 target vectors were used for assays. Both have identical complementary binding sites but differ slightly in the surrounding sequence. Both constructs produced similar results in dual luciferase assays. [0237] ASO1 MAPT target sequence context, variant 1 : 5’ - AATAATCTGTAAAAGTGAATTTGGAAATA - 3’ (SEQ ID NO: 169) [0238] ASO1 MAPT target sequence context, variant 2: 5’ - CACTGACTGTTAATGTAAAAGTGAATTTGGAAATATTGTAATTACTCTG - 3’ (SEQ ID NO: 170) [0239] Underlined area indicates ASO1 complementary sequence. [0240] ASO2 and ASO3 bind to overlapping sequences and are assayed using the same pGL4.13[luc2/SV40] plasmid vector reporter derivative. ASO2 and ASO3 binding sequences are indicated by bold and underlined fonts, respectively. 5’ - ATTTTGGCCACTTTGCAGACCTGGGACTTTAGGGCTAACCATT - 3’ (SEQ ID NO: 171) [0241] The accuracy of all target constructs and DNA preparations are verified by DNA sequencing. [0242] The following gapmers targeting the above MAPT target sequences were used as control sequences: Seql-Control: 21.5 nM IC50, non-toxic +A*dT*+T*+T*+C*dC*dA*dA*dA*dT*dT*dC*dA*dC*dT*+T*+T*dT*+A*+C (SEQ ID NO: 161) ATTTCCAAATTCACTTTTAC (SEQ ID NO: 162) Seq2-Control: 150 nM IC50, toxic in in vivo screen Kl*Kl*+C*dT*dA*dA*dA*dG*dT*dC*dC*+C*+A*+G (SEQ ID NO: 163) CCCTAAAGTCCCAG (SEQ ID NO: 164) Seq3-Control: 40 nM IC50, non-toxic +T*+A*+G*dC*dC*dC*dT*dA*dA*dA*dG*dT*dC*+C*+C*+A (SEQ ID NO: 165) TAGCCCTAAAGTCCCA (SEQ ID NO: 166) Negative-Control: non-toxic +C*dC*+A*+A*+A*dT*dC*dT*dT*dA*dT*dA*dA*dT*dA*+A*+C*dT*+A*+C (SEQ ID NO: 167) CCAAATCTTATAATAACTAC (SEQ ID NO: 168) [0243] All dual luciferase assays used HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells. Cells were maintained using McCoy’s 5 A basal medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1.5 mM L-glutamine without antibiotics and incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were seeded one day before transfection into 96-well plates at 10,000 cells/well in 100 pl of medium. [0244] For dual luciferase assays, cells were co-transfected with the following final amounts of nucleic acids on a per well basis: the ASO test article at the appropriate concentration; 19 ng of the cognate pGL4.13[luc2/SV40] plasmid target vector; 1.0 ng of the pNLl.l.PGK[Nluc/PGK] plasmid (Promega) as an internal standard for normalization; and 55 ng of pUC plasmid as carrier. Transfection mixes on a per well basis contain: 5 pl of a mix of all plasmids at 20X final concentration; 5 pl of the test ASO in IX PBS at 20X of the final concentration, or vehicle (IX PBS) for no knockdown control; and 10 pl of 1 :50 Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo) dilution in OptiMEM (Gibco). After incubation according to manufacturer’s instructions for Lipofectamine 2000, the nucleic acid/lipofectamine mixture (20 ul) was added to cells that in wells with 80 pl of fresh medium. In practice, a plasmid master mix was used to generate a 5X (100 ul) transfection mix (nucleic acids/Lipofectamine) for each ASO condition, to be assayed in technical triplicate by aliquoting 20 ul/well to three 96 wells contain 80 pl medium. [0245] The cell medium was replaced with 175 pl of fresh complete medium the day following transfection and incubation continued until termination of the assay at 48 hours. At that point, cell medium was removed, and transfected cells washed with cold IX PBS which was completely removed before the addition of 50 pl of IX Dual Luciferase Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Lysis was completed by shaking for 15-30 minutes at room temperature; lysates may be assayed immediately or stored at -80 °C. [0246] Dual luciferase assays were performed using the Promega Nano-Gio Dual- Luciferase Reporter Assay System according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ASO target luciferase values (cognate target pGL4.13[luc2/SV40] plasmid output) were normalized to Nano- Glo luciferase values (pNLl. l.PGK[Nluc/PGK] plasmid output) on a per well basis. For ASO screens, target knockdown was expressed as a fraction of average ASO triplicate value relative to average vehicle (no ASO) value. For full dose-response curves, each ASO value as expressed relative to the average vehicle control and plotted in GraphPad Prism using log(inhibitor) vs. response (three parameters) least squares fit. [0247] FIG. 10A shows a graphic representation of the relative luminescence data of exemplary oligonucleotide constructs derived from control sequence 1. [0248] These data suggests no loss in the antisense activity after adding hairpin structure to the stem-loop ASO constructs. Comparable or improved activity was observed in the stem-loop ASO constructs compared to the original gapmer design. An improved activity was also observed after reducing phosphorothioate backbone sites, particularly in the ASO domain (e.g., portion of the ASO domain protected by the protection domain). [0249] FIG. 10B shows a graphic representation of the target protein expression of exemplary oligonucleotide constructs derived from control sequence 2 and control sequence 3. The dashed lines in FIG. 10B mark target expression for parental ASO controls at 10 nM. The data suggests that for sequence 2, designs with a 8-nt toehold and 6-nt duplex are more potent than designs with a 6-nt toehold and 8-nt duplex. The location of the palmitic acid does not appear to significantly affect the potency for sequence 2 and 3 designs. Designs with a 5’ toehold can be more potent than designs with a 3’ toehold in some cases. Example 2 Single point screening of stem-loop antisense oligonucleotides by free uptake [0250] In this example, stem-loop ASOs were screened in a single point assay format for down selection. The selected constructs can be used for multi-point dose activity curve. [0251] Prior to the single point screening, quality control (QC) check was performed on ASOs. To validate the ASO structure, ASOs were heated at 95 °C for 5 minutes via thermocycler, with the temperature slowly dropping down to 25 °C at 0.1 °C/sec. Samples were run on a 20% TBE gel and stained with 0.2 pg/mL of ethidium bromide for 30 minutes followed by a 15-minute wash with ddFLO To check the ASO concentration, ASOs were diluted to 10 pM in O.lx filtered DPBS and the absorbance was measured at 260 nm. The Beer-Lambert Law was used to verify that the ASOs were reconstituted to the correct concentration. FIG. 11 provides the data from the QC check of exemplary ASOs. The best screening concentration was determined to be 1 pM after pilot experiment. For GABANeurons, purity, mycoplasma, and sterility of the iCell GABANeurons and culture medium were validated by the distributor. [0252] To validate the primer probe set, three commercial MAPT primer probe sets and two housekeeping/reference genes were tested against the RNA extracted from the neurons upon thaw. One MAPT primer probe set (Hs.PT.58.28269192) and the two reference genes (Hs.PT.39a.22214847, Hs.PT.58.3714142) were used in a multiplexed qPCR for the primary and dose response screens. RiboGreen reagent and nanodrop measurements were used to quantitate the amount of RNA yield achieved from a 384-well plate. For dose optimization, an ACNT1 ASO was used to verify the ASO concentration needed to conduct the primary single dose screen. Cells were treated with ASO on day 2 post-thaw and RNA was extracted on post-transfection days 5, 6, and 7. Results suggest that scaling up to a 96-well plate with 40,000 cells per well and extracting RNA on post-transfection day 5 are preferrable. MAPT LNA gapmers used in Example 1 above were also used as control sequences in this example. [0253] To conduct a primary screen, GABAneurons were seeded at 40,000 cells per well and treated on day 3 post-thaw. A 50% media change was conducted every other day until RNA extraction, which occurred 5 days post transfection. RNA yield was assessed via Quant-it™ RiboGreen RNA assay. MAPT expression was measured via qPCT, and normalized to ACTB using the Pfaffl method. [0254] FIG. 12 is a plot showing qPCT standard curves of ACTB and MAPT. FIGS. 13- 18 are plots showing the antisense activity of exemplary stem-loop ASOs in comparison to controls. In particular, FIGS. 13 and 14 are plots showing the antisense activity of exemplary stem-loop ASOs with a 5’ overhang (FIG. 13) and a 3’ overhang (FIG. 14) derived from control Sequence 1 (SEQ ID NO: 161 or 162). FIGS. 15 and 16 are plots showing the antisense activity of exemplary stem-loop ASOs with a 5’ overhang (FIG. 15) and a 3’ overhang (FIG. 16) derived from control Sequence 2 (SEQ ID NO: 163 or 164). FIGS. 17 and 18 are plots showing the antisense activity of exemplary stem-loop ASOs with a 5’ overhang (FIG. 17) and a 3’ overhang (FIG. 18) derived from control Sequence 3 (SEQ ID NO: 165 or 166). FIG. 19 provides plots showing the antisense activity of control sequences. [0255] The single point screening assay identifies hairpin ASOs with either comparable or improved activity compared to the original gapmer design The data also suggests that reducing the number of phosphorothioate linkages in the ASO domain can be beneficial for improved potency of target knockdown. The effect of a terminal palmitic acid on the ASO performance appears sequence specific. In some cases, additional spacer 2’-0Me bases added in the hairpin loop does not appear to improve the potency of the ASO. Furthermore, different parental ASO sequences can be more or less potent depending on whether a 3\\' or 5\\' toehold is used. For the exemplary sequence 1, designs with 5\\' toeholds are more potent than designs with 3\\' toeholds. However, for sequence 2 and sequence 3, designs with 3\\' and 5\\' toeholds are equally active. Example 3 MAPT modulation by exemplary stem-loop antisense oligonucleotides [0256] In this example, positive control ASOs seql -control 1 and seq2-control 1, along with three hairpin ASOs were tested in iPSC GABA neurons out to 7 and 10 days. GABAneurons were seeded at 40,000 cells per well and treated on day 2 post-thaw. The cells were treated at a starting concentration of 3 uM ASO following five, log(3) serial dilutions. A 50% media change was conducted every other day until RNA extraction, which occurred at day 7 and day 10 post transfection. RNA yield was assessed via Quant-it™ RiboGreen RNA Assay. MAPT expression was measured via qPCR and normalized to ACTB using the Pfaffl method. [0257] The following compounds were selected for this study: 1. S2021-1 : Seql -Control 1 2. S2021-2: Seq2-Control 1 3. S2013-13: 1-5A-12-6 4. S2013-28: 1-5B-12-6 5. S2013-10: 1-5A-10-6 [0258] For ASO quality check, the concentrations were verified by measuring the absorbance (260 nm) with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer after the initial thermal annealing step. For GABANeurons quality check, neurons were seeded in a 96-well plate in wells B2 - G11 to avoid edge effects. Neurons were assessed under phase contrast microscopy and images of the neurons dosed at the highest ASO concentration were captured every day until RNA extraction. FIG. 20 shows qPCT standard curves of ACTB and MAPT at day 7 (upper panel) and day 10 (lower panel). Two biological and two technical replicates were used in the qPCR assay. Cq values from RNA extracted at 7 days appear to be around 1 to 1.5 Cq values lower than RNA extracted at 10 days post transfection. Cq values of the samples at 7 days have a median of 23.0 (ACTB) and 25.1 (MAPT) vs. the median Cq values at 10 days which is 24.3 (ACTB) and 25.8 (MAPT). The Cq values of the samples at 7 days (Table 13) and 10 days (Table 14) are shown in the following tables. [0259] Table 13. Cq values of samples at day 7. [0260] Table 14. Cq values of samples at day 10. [0261] Total RNA yield was assessed via Quant-it™ RiboGreen RNA Assay (ThermoFisher, Cat. # R11490). Results showed that more total RNA yield was extracted at 7 days vs. 10 days post transfection (data not shown). These results are comparative to what was observed with the Cq values in the qPCR assay. [0262] Five compounds (2 controls and 3 samples) were selected for dose response. The knock down effects were compared at 2 different time points (7 days and 10 days post transfection). The 10-day time point was sufficient for generating IC50s in the 2 controls and 1 sample (1-5A-10- 6). Two samples (1-5A-12-6 and 1-5B-12-6) did not have sufficient knock down to calculate IC50 values. FIGS. 21A-B provide bar charts representation of MAPT expression when treated with selected compounds at different doses 7 days (FIG. 21 A) and 10 days (FIG. 21B) post transfection. [0263] Relative IC50 values were calculated using the function: Y=Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/(l+(X/IC50)), where the top and bottom are plateaus defined by the y-values of the dose response curve, and the bottom is equivalent to the baseline. [0264] Absolute IC50 values were calculated using the equations: F ifty=(T op+Baseline)/2 Y= Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/(l+((Top-Bottom)/(Fifty-Bottom)-l)*(AbsoluteIC50/X) A HillSlope) where the top and bottom are plateaus defined by the y-values of the dose response curve, and the baseline is equivalent to the bottom value of Seql-Controll. [0265] FIG. 22 provides tables showing IC50 values for samples at day 7 and 10 post transfection. FIGS. 23A-E provide plots showing dose response results of each compound (FIG. 23A: Seql-Control 1; FIG. 23B: Seq2-Control 1; FIG. 23C: 1-5A-10-6; FIG. 23D: 1-5A-12-6; FIG. 23E: 1-5B-12-6) at day 7 and day 10 post transfection. The bar chart plot on the left represents the results from primary screen transfection (see Example 2) with ASO concentration of 1 pM 5 days post transfection. [0266] The data shows deeper knockdown by tested ASOs 10 days after exposure. The knockdown effects by hairpin ASO 1-5A-10-6 were not as pronounced as the single point experiment, which could be due to experimental variations. Example 4 Toxicity assay of exemplary stem-loop oligonucleotides [0267] In this example, LDH cytotoxicity assay of exemplary stem-loop ASOs were performed in a time-dependent manner. Supernatants from the samples were collected every other day during the 50% media changes. The measured timepoints are as follows: day 0 (day of transfection/2 days post thaw); and days 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 10 post transfection. Standard operating procedures were followed to carry out the LDH-Glo™ Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, Cat. #J2381 ). [0268] For assay quality check, a standard curve was generated using the LDH positive control provided by Promega. Sample data fell within the lower end of the linear range with a minimum RLU at 8,209 and a maximum RLU at 159,385. An increase in LDH was observed at day 0 (2 days post thaw). LDH levels appear higher at days 2 and 4 post transfection but decreased at day 6 and remained constant through day 10. FIGS. 24A-E provide scatter plots of LDH measurement assay in relative light units of exemplary ASO samples. Example 5 Evaluating adapter strands for the delivery of morpholinos [0269] In this example, adapter strands were designed to deliver three exemplary morpholino drugs. The morpholino oligonucleotides (PMO) were purchased together with adapter sequences and RNA strands simulating targets. The three exemplary PMOs include Golodirsen (//gsrs. neats. nih.gov/ginas/app/beta/substances/e54505d8-4af5-43f6-95b4-f70effe0b457), Casimersen (//gsrs. neats. nih. gov/ginas/app/beta/substances/905e0fD5-b9c5-412c-a0el- 5bb898111944) and Eteplirsen (//gsrs. neats. nih.gov/ginas/app/beta/substances/4d0cddf7-f088-45af- af78-27659898e442). Detailed information about these morpholinos can be found in the Global Substance Registration System (GSRS) (gsrs.ncats.nih.gov/ginas/app/beta/home). [0270] Morpholinos have similar binding affinity as DNAs for RNA strands. Therefore, fairly long adapter regions (base-paring between delivery strand and morpholino oligos) need to be used to achieve stable complex. At least an 8 nt toehold on the morpholino is also preferred so that it can interact with its RNA target with a desired binding affinity. In some cases, a compromise needs to be made between adapter base-pairing stability and morpholino toehold length on some strands. The designed strands were also checked for unintended complementarity between the adapter strands and RNA transcripts in the human genome. All adapter strands were designed with 2’-0Me base modifications and PS modifications for the single-stranded regions and terminal regions. The sequences of exemplary adaptor strands evaluated in this example are provided in Table 12 in the Sequences section below. [0271] Annealing was carried out to demonstrate that duplex ASO constructs can be readily assembled from the adapter strands and PMOs such as the FDA approved PMO drugs. Briefly, stock solutions were prepared for each oligos (10-20pM) in water. 1 pM solution for individual oligos were then prepared in water. Duplex (Ad-5P/ASO-M, Ad-3P/ASO-M & Target/ASO-M) were made at 1 uM for each component in 1XPBS. AD/ASO-M duplex were prepared under the following thermal profile: 95/90/80/70/65/60/55/50/45/40/35/30/25 (10 min)/4 °C O.N. 0.1 degree/S with ramp speed at 5 degree/50 S for a duration of 3 min at each step. Adapter strands and PMOs were annealed on thermocycler for about 40 mins from 95 °C to 25 °C and then analyzed on 20% TBE gel. As shown in FIG. 25, the Casimersen adapter strands and Casimersen PMOs were properly assembled to form duplex ASO constructs. [0272] Next, the duplex casimersen-adapter complex is exposed with an RNA strand mimicking the target of casimersen. Prior to the procedure, tubes containing oligos, duplexes and targets were warmed up at RT. The thermocycler was pre-heated at 25 °C and 37 °C. 25 ul of the target was aliquoted into 8-strip tubes and stored at RT (1 & 3) or at 37 °C (2 & 4). 25 ul of preannealed duplex was added into the target at each timepoint. 3.5 ul of SB buffer were prepared in 8- strip tubes. Right after adding the target at t=0 into the duplex, 7 ul of each reaction was transferred into the 8-strip tubes containing SB and run on 20% TBE gel. [0273] FIGS. 26A-D show images from gel electrophoresis of duplex casimersen ASOs mixed with casimersen targets at 25 °C and 37 °C (FIGS. 26A-B: duplex with 5’ adapter; FIGS. 26C-D: duplex with 3’ adapter). Incubation after addition of target into the pre-annealed duplex: 8A, 9A: 0 min, 8B, 9B: 30 min; 8C, 9C: 60 min; 8D, 9D: 90 min; 8E, 9E: 120 min. [0274] The data suggests that when the casimersen-adapter complex is exposed to an RNA strand mimicking the target of casimersen, the target strand base-pairs with casimersen, displacing the 3’ and 5’ adapters at 25 °C and 37 °C. [0275] Similar experiments were also performed for golodirsen adapter strands, ASO strands and targets, as well as for eteplirsen adapter strands, ASO strands and targets using the same procedure described above for casimersen. 7 pl of each sample and 3.5 pl of SB buffer were analyzed on 20% TBE gel. [0276] FIG. 27A shows results and images from gel electrophoresis indicating that golodirsen adapter strands and golodirsen PMOs were properly assembled to form duplex ASO constructs. FIG. 27B shows results and images from gel electrophoresis indicating that eteplirsen adapter strands and eteplirsen PMOs were properly assembled to form duplex ASO constructs. Annealing of golodirsen and eteplirsen with their respective 3’ and 5’ adapter strands show efficient assembly into duplexes. [0277] The same procedures were also used to further test non-specific switch by incubating 25 ul of pre-annealed duplex (Cas-M/Ad-5P or Ad-3P, 1 uM) and 25 ul target (Cas, Golo or Etep, 1 uM) at 25 °C for 2 hrs. [0278] FIGS. 28A-B show results and images from gel electrophoresis of duplex casimersen ASOs (FIG. 28 A: 5’ adapter; FIG. 28B: 3’ adapter) mixed with casimersen, golodirsen, and eteplirsen targets. Exposure of casimersen-adapter complexes to casimersen-target RNA strands show displacement of the adapters from the casimersen PMO, but exposure to targets for golodirsen and eteplirsen show no displacement effect. This demonstrates that displacement is sequence specific and based on toehold mediated strand displacement, as intended.

Terminology [0292] In at least some of the previously described embodiments, one or more elements used in an embodiment can interchangeably be used in another embodiment unless such a replacement is not technically feasible. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various other omissions, additions and modifications may be made to the methods and structures described above without departing from the scope of the claimed subject matter. All such modifications and changes are intended to fall within the scope of the subject matter, as defined by the appended claims. [0293] With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application. The various singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Any reference to “or” herein is intended to encompass “and/or” unless otherwise stated. [0294] It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as “open” terms (e.g., the term “including” should be interpreted as “including but not limited to,” the term “having” should be interpreted as “having at least,” the term “includes” should be interpreted as “includes but is not limited to,” etc ). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases “at least one” and “one or more” to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles “a” or “an” limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases “one or more” or “at least one” and indefinite articles such as “a” or “an” e.g., “a” and/or “an” should be interpreted to mean “at least one” or “one or more”); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of “two recitations,” without other modifiers, means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to “at least one of A, B, and C, etc.” is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., “a system having at least one of A, B, and C” would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to “at least one of A, B, or C, etc.” is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., “a system having at least one of A, B, or C” would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase “A or B” will be understood to include the possibilities of “A” or “B” or “A and B.” [0295] In addition, where features or aspects of the disclosure are described in terms of Markush groups, those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosure is also thereby described in terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the Markush group. [0296] As will be understood by one skilled in the art, for any and all purposes, such as in terms of providing a written description, all ranges disclosed herein also encompass any and all possible sub-ranges and combinations of sub-ranges thereof Any listed range can be easily recognized as sufficiently describing and enabling the same range being broken down into at least equal halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, tenths, etc. As a non-limiting example, each range discussed herein can be readily broken down into a lower third, middle third and upper third, etc. As will also be understood by one skilled in the art all language such as “up to,” “at least,” “greater than,” “less than,” and the like include the number recited and refer to ranges which can be subsequently broken down into sub-ranges as discussed above. Finally, as will be understood by one skilled in the art, a range includes each individual member. Thus, for example, a group having 1-3 articles refers to groups having 1, 2, or 3 articles. Similarly, a group having 1-5 articles refers to groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 articles, and so forth. [0297] While various aspects and embodiments have been disclosed herein, other aspects and embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The various aspects and embodiments disclosed herein are for purposes of illustration and are not intended to be limiting, with the true scope and spirit being indicated by the following claims.',\n

Sequence Listing The sequence listing contained in the electronic file titled “_VAND-0224-PCT.xml” created 19 June 2022 and comprising 63 kb, is hereby incorporated herein. Background The present invention relates to certain novel antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and, more particularly, to pharmaceutical compositions thereof and to methods for treating certain diseases or conditions in which regulating protein synthesis using ASOs can have therapeutic value. More particularly aspects of the present invention relate to the treatment of known disorders such as polycythemia vera (PV) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as well as Charcot-Maric-Tooth type 2 (CMT2) disease. PV is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by erythroid hyperplasia, myeloid leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and splenomegaly. Most individuals diagnosed with PV carry a valine-to-phenylalanine mutation at position 617 (V617F) of the JAK2 gene. MDS is a group of clonal hematologic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, often resulting in anemia. Some cases of MDS have been associated with the same V617F mutation of the JAK2 gene and specifically with an increased platelet count. The JAK2 gene codes for a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth, development, differentiation, and histone modifications, as well as cytokine and growth factor signaling. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, causes damage to the peripheral nerves and nerves involved in muscle - 1 - RECTIFIED SHEET (RULE 91) ISA/EP control. Symptoms are progressive, often beginning in the feet and lower legs and then the fingers, hands, and arms. Nearly all cases of CMT are inherited. More than 40 genes have been associated with CMT. Some genes are associated with more than one form of CMT and some forms of CMT are associated with more than one gene. As such, it is possible for an individual to suffer from more than one form of CMT as a result of more than one inherited mutation. More than half of all CMT cases are caused by a duplication of the PMP22 gene on chromosome 17. Other forms of CMT are caused by X-linked mutations. CMT type 2 (CMT2) is a less common subtype of CMT affecting nerve axons. Most forms of CMT2 are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, though some forms, including CMT type 2S (CMT2S), are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. As such, symptoms associated with CMT2S are typically less severe than in autosomal dominant forms of CMT2. The mutation associated with CMT2S is a mutation of the IGHMBP2 (immunoglobulin mu DNA binding protein 2) gene on chromosome 11 , leading to abnormal RNA processing and axonal neuropathy. Summary An “antisense oligonucleotide” or “ASO” refers to a synthetic, multi-nucleotide RNA compound that hybridizes to a target RNA sequence in a manner such that gene expression can be inhibited, including by inactivating an mRNA molecule. The invention provides a method of treating a patient diagnosed with MDS which comprises administering to the patient an amount of an ASO-T-JAK2 compound effective to treat MDS. In accordance with the present invention an ASO-T-JAK2 compound refers to any antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding JAK2. In addition, an amount of the ASO-T-JAK2 compound effective to treat MDS requires administration of the compound in a quantity effective to inhibit JAK2 protein expression on the patient. As noted above, the term “ASO-T-JAK2” refers to an ASO targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding the gene JAK2. The term “nucleic acid molecule” is a reference to a polynucleotide compound, i.e., RNA. An “antisense oligonucleotide” or “ASO” references a synthetic, multi-nucleotide DNA compound that hybridizes to a target RNA in a manner such that gene expression can be inhibited, including by inactivating an mRNA compound. Illustrative ASO-T-JAK2 compounds are disclosed herein (SEQ. ID. 4 and 5 targeting SEQ. ID. 2 and 3, respectively). Additional ASO-T-JAK2 compounds can be identified and prepared by methods known in the art for developing antisense oligonucleotides specific to a target RNA sequence. The term “ASO-T-IGHMBP2” refers to an ASO targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding the IGHMBP2 gene. The term “nucleic acid molecule” is a reference to a polynucleotide compound, i.e., RNA. Illustrative ASO-T-IGHMBP2 compounds are disclosed and described in detail below. Additional ASO-T-IGHMBP2 compounds can be identified and prepared by methods known in the art for developing ASOs specific to a target RNA sequence. A “patient” as referenced above references an individual diagnosed with, suffering from, or at risk of developing, being diagnosed with, or suffering from a disease or disorder, specifically PV or MDS or CMT2S. In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating a patient diagnosed with PV which comprises administering to the patient an amount of an ASO-T-JAK2 compound effective to treat PV. An amount effective of the ASO-T- JAK2 compound effective to treat PV is an amount effective to inhibit JAK2 protein expression in the patient. In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a method of inhibiting expression of the JAK2 gene in an individual which comprises administering to the individual an amount of an ASO-T-JAK2 compound effective to accomplish such inhibition. In still another embodiment, the invention provides novel ASO-T-JAK2 compounds. As noted above, such compounds included, but are not limited to the oligonucleotides of SEQ ID 4 and SEQ ID 5. Numerous methods exist in the art for preparing ASOs once the nucleotide base sequence thereof have been determined. The determination of the appropriate sequence of bases for an ASO-T-JAK2 compound is likewise accomplished by strategies known in the art for identifying gene sequences for which an ASO would inhibit protein expression by the gene upon RNA binding. In the treatment of an individual patient by administration of an ASO-T-JAK2, the dose and dosage regiment can be readily determined. Numerous examples of approved dosing for ASOs are known in the art, including nusinersen (marketed as Spinraza), mipomersen (marketed as Kynamro), and fomivirsen (marketed as Vitravene). In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous to administer the ASO- T-JAK2 in a derivatized or modified form in order to optimize bioavailability, duration of action, or therapeutic effect otherwise. Methods are known in the art for such modification/derivatization.

Brief Description of the Drawings These and other features of this invention will be more readily understood from the following detailed description of the various aspects of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings that depict various embodiments of the invention, in which: HG. 1 shows the results of a bioluminescence assay in which ASO treatment inhibits JAK2 expression and decreases cell viability; FIGS. 2A and 2B show, respectively, fluorescent and brightfield images of SET-2 cells treated with ASOs according to embodiments of the invention; FIGS. 3A and 3B show, respectively, fluorescent and brightfield images of HEL cells treated with ASOs according to embodiments of the invention; HGS. 4A and 4B show, respectively, fluorescent and brightfield images of SET-2 cells treated with ASOs according to embodiments of the invention; and FIGS. 5A and 5B show, respectively, fluorescent and brightfield images of HEL cells treated with ASOs according to embodiments of the invention. It is noted that the drawings of the invention are not to scale. The drawings are intended to depict only typical aspects of the invention, and therefore should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention. In the drawings, like numbering represents like elements among the drawings. Detailed Description The present invention provides target sequences in the JAK2 pre-mRNA that are amenable to binding by a synthetic ASO. When so bound, expression of the JAK2 gene is inhibited. In patients diagnosed with MDS and PV, such inhibition of JAK2 expression provides an effective method of treatment of the disorder. As noted above, MDS and PV are both associated with the V617F mutation of the JAK2 protein. The wildtype JAK2 protein sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO 1 in which the amino acid at position 617 is valine. In one aspect of the present invention, a target region within the JAK2 pre-mRNA molecule is identified that, when bound with an ASO, is capable of inhibiting synthesis of the JAK2 protein. This region includes a 19 bp sequence: TTTCCTTAGTCTTTCTTTG (SEQ ID NO 2) and the shorter 16 bp sequence: CCTTAGTCTTTCTTTG (SEQ ID NO 3). Complementary ASO sequences are, respectively: 5’ -CA A AGA A AGACU A AGGA A A-3 ’ (SEQ ID NO 4) and: 5 -CAAAGAAAGACUAAGG-3’ (SEQ ID NO 5). Each of these sequences bridges an intron and exon of the JAK2 pre-mRNA. When ASOs containing these sequences are bound to JAK2 pre-mRNA, processing of the pre-mRNA into mature mRNA is prevented, as is synthesis of the JAK2 protein. To test the efficacy of ASOs having SEQ ID NO 4 and/or SEQ ID NO 5 to bind to the JAK2 pre-mRNA and inhibit JAK2 protein synthesis, three human cell lines (SET-2, HEL, CMK) are incubated with each of these ASOs and treated with cycloheximide. After a 48-hour incubation, the treated cell lines are collected and subjected to a CellTiter-Glo® (CTG) assay and RNA extraction. Data related to the cell lines and culture media are shown in Table 1 below. Table 1 Cells are harvested during the growth period and counted using a Ceilometer K2. One million cells are incubated in the listed medium in each well of a six-well plate and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . After 24 hours, the medium is changed, the ASO is added, and incubation is continued under the same conditions for another 24 hours. Cycloheximide is then added to a final concentration of 0. 1 mg/mL. Twenty-four hours after addition of the cycloheximide, the medium and cells are combined in a 15 mL conical tube and 50 pF aliquots of cells are added to a 96-well assay plate for CTG assaying. Luminescence is recorded using a BioTek Synergy neo2 Multi-mode Reader. The remaining cells are spun at 4 °C to collect a cell pellet for RNA extraction by Tryzol reagent. HG. 1 shows results of the CTG assay described above for the SET-2 cell line. In the first column is the result for the assay vehicle, which contains no ASOs. Average relative luminescence units (RLUs) are in excess of 3,000,000. RLU is proportional to the number of viable cells in the assay well. The second column shows the results of the assay when off-target control ASOs (z.e., ASOs not targeting JAK2 pre-mRNA or mRNA) are used. Average RLUs are reduced as compared to vehicle, but are still in excess of 2,500,000. The third column of FIG. 1 shows the results of the assay when ASOs containing SEQ ID NO 4 or SEQ ID NO 5 are added. Here, average RLUs are reduced to less than 2,000,000, with some samples exhibiting a reduction to approximately 1,500,000. This constitutes a significant reduction in RLUs, and consequently cell viability, as compared to vehicle. These results are confirmed with RNA sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to quantify expression of the JAK2 gene. FIGS. 2A and 2B show, respectively, fluorescent (GFP) and brightfield images of assay wells for SET -2 cells treated with ASOs containing SEQ ID NO 4 or SEQ ID NO 5. FIGS. 3A and 3B show, respectively, fluorescent and brightfield images for HEL cells treated with the same ASOs. In each case, fluorescence is lower than in untreated cells, demonstrating decreased mature JAK2 mRNA in samples incubated with ASOs containing SEQ ID NO 4 or SEQ ID NO 5. Thus, embodiments of the invention include the administration of an ASO containing SEQ ID NO 4, SEQ ID NO 5, or both, to an individual in order to inhibit expression of JAK2; such administration as a treatment for MDS, PV, or both; ASOs targeting SEQ ID NO 2, SEQ ID NO 3, or both; ASOs having nucleotide sequences that include SEQ ID NO 4 or SEQ ID NO 5; and compositions containing such ASOs in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, adjuvants, or combinations thereof. In other aspects, the present invention provides target sequences in the mutant IGHMBP2 pre-mRNA that are amenable to binding by a synthetic ASO. When so bound, expression of the mutant IGHMBP2 gene is inhibited. In patients diagnosed with CMT2S who are heterozygous for the mutation, such inhibition may result in the “rescue” or return to normal function of the IGHMBP2 protein. The full sequence of the wildtype IGHMBP2 gene is shown in the attached sequence listing as SEQ ID NO 6. The nucleotide at position 31401 is cytosine. In the mutation associated with CMT2S, this nucleotide is adenine. In one aspect of the present invention, a target region within the resulting mutant IGHMBP2 pre-mRNA molecule is identified that, when bound with an ASO, is capable of inhibiting synthesis of the mutant IGHMBP2 protein. That region within the mutant IGHMBP2 gene comprises a 19-bp sequence that includes the C31401 A mutation: CACTTCCACAGGGGGAAGA (SEQ ID NO 7). The complementary ASO sequence is: UCUUCCCCCUGUGGAAGUG (SEQ ID NO 8). An ASO comprising SEQ ID NO 3 bridges an intron and exon of the mutant IGHMBP2 pre-mRNA and, when bound to the pre-mRNA, prevents synthesis of the mutant IGHMBP2 protein. To test the efficacy of an ASO comprising SEQ ID NO 8 in binding to the mutant IGHMBP2 pre-mRNA and inhibiting mutant IGHMBP2 protein synthesis, a fibroblast cell line of a patient with CMT2S is incubated with an ASO including SEQ ID NO 8 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and treated with cycloheximide. After a 48-hour incubation, the treated cells are collected and for RNA extraction and Western Blot analysis to determine IGHMBP2 protein expression. More specifically, one million cells are incubated in 2 mL in the RPMI 1640 medium described above in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% carbon dioxide. After 24 hours, the medium is changed, the ASO is added, and incubation is continued for another 24 hours. Cycloheximide is then added to a final concentration of 0. 1 mg/mL. Twenty-four hours after addition of the cyclohgeximide, the medium and cells are combined in a 15 mL conical tube and spun to collect a cell pellet for RNA extraction by Tryzol reagent. RNA extraction is carried out using, for example, Qiagen’s RNeasy Mini Kit. Western Blot analysis is then carried out to determine the concentration of wild type and mutant proteins in the samples. HGS. 4A and 4B show fluorescent and brightfield photomicrographs, respectively, of SET-2 cells following treatment with ASOs including SEQ ID NO 8, demonstrating the ability of these ASOs to penetrate the cell membrane. HGS. 5A and 5B show similar fluorescent and brightfield photomicrographs, respectively, of HEL cells following treatment with ASOs including SEQ ID NO 8. Again, these results demonstrate the ability of such ASOs to penetrate the cell membrane. ASOs other than or in addition to those including SEQ ID NO 8 may be useful in practicing the invention. Applicant has identified a “core” 11 nucleotide sequence within SEQ ID NO 8 that would provide a basis for sequences having sufficient specificity to enable discriminate binding of an ASO to the mutant IGHMBP2 pre- mRNA. As one skilled in the art will understand, efficient and effective ASO therapies such as those described herein require the use of ASOs having a length sufficient to ensure discriminate binding of the ASO to the target sequence. ASOs including sequences of between 13 nucleotides and 35 nucleotides in length and including the core sequence of SEQ ID NO 9 are of sufficient length for use in practicing embodiments of the invention. 5’-CCCCCUGUGGA-3’ (SEQ ID NO 9) Thus, an ASO having a nucleotide sequence that includes SEQ ID NO 4 and between two and 24 adjacent nucleotides are useful in practicing embodiments of the invention. Such nucleotide sequences include, for example, sequences as short as the 13-nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NOS, 10, 11, and 12: 5’-CCCCCUGUGGAAG-3’ (SEQ ID NO 10) 5’-UCCCCCUGUGGAA-3’ (SEQ ID NO 11) 5 -UUCCCCCUGUGGA-3 (SEQ ID NO 12) Such nucleotide sequences also include, for example, sequences as long as the 35- nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NOS 13 and 14. 5 -GAAGAAAUCAAUCUUCCCCCUGUGGAAGUGAGGGC-3’ (SEQ ID NO 13) 5 -GAAAUCAAUCUUCCCCCUGUGGAAGUGAGGGCCAG-3’ (SEQ ID NO 14) More generally, ASOs having a nucleotide sequence between 13 nucleotides and 35 nucleotides in length comprising the core sequence of SEQ ID NO 9 and as many as 15 upstream nucleotides and/or 12 downstream nucleotides. The ASO “sequence window” is shown in SEQ ID NO 15. 5’-G A AGA A AUCA AUC1 JUCCCCCUGUGGA G1 JGAGGGCCAG-3 ’ (SEQ ID NO 15) As used herein, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

In this way, ASO::protein complexes may be produced that facilitate delivery of antisense DNA into target cells. Such complexes may be used to down-regulate gene expression in cells.',\n     'lang': 'en'}],\n   'publication_type': 'PATENT_APPLICATION'},\n  {'lens_id': '195-671-825-676-507',\n   'jurisdiction':

Sequence Listing The sequence listing contained in the electronic file titled “\\\\txt_VAND-0224- PCT.xml,” created 19 June 2022 and comprising 63 kb, is hereby incorporated herein. Background The present invention relates to certain novel antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and, more particularly, to pharmaceutical compositions thereof and to methods for treating certain diseases or conditions in which regulating protein synthesis using ASOs can have therapeutic value. More particularly aspects of the present invention relate to the treatment of known disorders such as polycythemia vera (PV) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as well as Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 (CMT2) disease. PV is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by erythroid hyperplasia, myeloid leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and splenomegaly. Most individuals diagnosed with PV carry a valine-to-phenylalanine mutation at position 617 (V617F) of the JAK2 gene. MDS is a group of clonal hematologic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, often resulting in anemia. Some cases of MDS have been associated with the same V617F mutation of the JAK2 gene and specifically with an increased platelet count. The JAK2 gene codes for a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth, development, differentiation, and histone modifications, as well as cytokine and growth factor signaling. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, causes damage to the peripheral nerves and nerves involved in muscle control. Symptoms are progressive, often beginning in the feet and lower legs and then the fingers, hands, and arms. Nearly all cases of CMT are inherited. More than 40 genes have been associated with CMT. Some genes are associated with more than one form of CMT and some forms of CMT are associated with more than one gene. As such, it is possible for an individual to suffer from more than one form of CMT as a result of more than one inherited mutation. More than half of all CMT cases are caused by a duplication of the PMP22 gene on chromosome 17. Other forms of CMT are caused by X-linked mutations. CMT type 2 (CMT2) is a less common subtype of CMT affecting nerve axons. Most forms of CMT2 are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, though some forms, including CMT type 2S (CMT2S), are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. As such, symptoms associated with CMT2S are typically less severe than in autosomal dominant forms of CMT2. The mutation associated with CMT2S is a mutation of the IGHMBP2 (immunoglobulin mu DNA binding protein 2) gene on chromosome 11 , leading to abnormal RNA processing and axonal neuropathy. Summary An “antisense oligonucleotide” or “ASO” refers to a synthetic, multi-nucleotide RNA compound that hybridizes to a target RNA sequence in a manner such that gene expression can be inhibited, including by inactivating an mRNA molecule. The invention provides a method of treating a patient diagnosed with MDS which comprises administering to the patient an amount of an ASO-T-JAK2 compound effective to treat MDS. In accordance with the present invention an ASO-T-JAK2 compound refers to any antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding JAK2. In addition, an amount of the ASO-T-JAK2 compound effective to treat MDS requires administration of the compound in a quantity effective to inhibit JAK2 protein expression on the patient. As noted above, the term “ASO-T-JAK2” refers to an ASO targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding the gene JAK2. The term “nucleic acid molecule” is a reference to a polynucleotide compound, i.e., RNA. An “antisense oligonucleotide” or “ASO” references a synthetic, multi-nucleotide DNA compound that hybridizes to a target RNA in a manner such that gene expression can be inhibited, including by inactivating an mRNA compound. Illustrative ASO-T-JAK2 compounds are disclosed herein (SEQ. ID. 4 and 5 targeting SEQ. ID. 2 and 3, respectively). Additional ASO-T-JAK2 compounds can be identified and prepared by methods known in the art for developing antisense oligonucleotides specific to a target RNA sequence. The term “ASO-T-IGHMBP2” refers to an ASO targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding the IGHMBP2 gene. The term “nucleic acid molecule” is a reference to a polynucleotide compound, i.e., RNA. Illustrative ASO-T-IGHMBP2 compounds are disclosed and described in detail below. Additional ASO-T-IGHMBP2 compounds can be identified and prepared by methods known in the art for developing ASOs specific to a target RNA sequence. A “patient” as referenced above references an individual diagnosed with, suffering from, or at risk of developing, being diagnosed with, or suffering from a disease or disorder, specifically PV or MDS or CMT2S. In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating a patient diagnosed with PV which comprises administering to the patient an amount of an ASO-T-JAK2 compound effective to treat PV. An amount effective of the ASO-T- JAK2 compound effective to treat PV is an amount effective to inhibit JAK2 protein expression in the patient. In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a method of inhibiting expression of the JAK2 gene in an individual which comprises administering to the individual an amount of an ASO-T-JAK2 compound effective to accomplish such inhibition. In still another embodiment, the invention provides novel ASO-T-JAK2 compounds. As noted above, such compounds included, but are not limited to the oligonucleotides of SEQ ID 4 and SEQ ID 5. Numerous methods exist in the art for preparing ASOs once the nucleotide base sequence thereof have been determined. The determination of the appropriate sequence of bases for an ASO-T-JAK2 compound is likewise accomplished by strategies known in the art for identifying gene sequences for which an ASO would inhibit protein expression by the gene upon RNA binding. In the treatment of an individual patient by administration of an ASO-T-JAK2, the dose and dosage regiment can be readily determined. Numerous examples of approved dosing for ASOs are known in the art, including nusinersen (marketed as Spinraza), mipomersen (marketed as Kynamro), and fomivirsen (marketed as Vitravene). In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous to administer the ASO- T-JAK2 in a derivatized or modified form in order to optimize bioavailability, duration of action, or therapeutic effect otherwise. Methods are known in the art for such modification/derivatization.

(2011 Jan); 100(1): 38-52. For the purposes of the present invention the ASOs are administered intravenously, though other routes of administration are possible, including oral administration. Such alternative routes of administration are applicable to the ASOs described herein. Accordingly, a further aspect of the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions that are used for the administration of the ASO-T-JAK2 compound to the patient being treated.

Brief Description of the Drawings These and other features of this invention will be more readily understood from the following detailed description of the various aspects of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings that depict various embodiments of the invention, in which: FIG. 1 shows the results of a bioluminescence assay in which ASO treatment inhibits JAK2 expression and decreases cell viability; FIGS. 2A and 2B show, respectively, fluorescent and brightfield images of SET-2 cells treated with ASOs according to embodiments of the invention; FIGS. 3A and 3B show, respectively, fluorescent and brightfield images of HEL cells treated with ASOs according to embodiments of the invention; FIGS. 4A and 4B show, respectively, fluorescent and brightfield images of SET-2 cells treated with ASOs according to embodiments of the invention; and FIGS. 5A and 5B show, respectively, fluorescent and brightfield images of HEL cells treated with ASOs according to embodiments of the invention. It is noted that the drawings of the invention are not to scale. The drawings are intended to depict only typical aspects of the invention, and therefore should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention. In the drawings, like numbering represents like elements among the drawings. Detailed Description The present invention provides target sequences in the JAK2 pre-mRNA that are amenable to binding by a synthetic ASO. When so bound, expression of the JAK2 gene is inhibited. In patients diagnosed with MDS and PV, such inhibition of JAK2 expression provides an effective method of treatment of the disorder. As noted above, MDS and PV are both associated with the V617F mutation of the JAK2 protein. The wildtype JAK2 protein sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO 1 in which the amino acid at position 617 is valine. In one aspect of the present invention, a target region within the JAK2 pre-mRNA molecule is identified that, when bound with an ASO, is capable of inhibiting synthesis of the JAK2 protein. This region includes a 19 bp sequence: TTT CCTT AGT CTTT CTTT G (SEQ ID NO 2) and the shorter 16 bp sequence: CCTT AGT CTTT CTTT G (SEQ ID NO 3). Complementary ASO sequences are, respectively: 5’ -CA A AGA A AGACU A AGGA A A-3 ’ (SEQ ID NO 4) and: 5 -CAAAGAAAGACUAAGG-3’ (SEQ ID NO 5). Each of these sequences bridges an intron and exon of the JAK2 pre-mRNA. When ASOs containing these sequences are bound to JAK2 pre-mRNA, processing of the pre-mRNA into mature mRNA is prevented, as is synthesis of the JAK2 protein. To test the efficacy of ASOs having SEQ ID NO 4 and/or SEQ ID NO 5 to bind to the JAK2 pre-mRNA and inhibit JAK2 protein synthesis, three human cell lines (SET-2, HEL, CMK) are incubated with each of these ASOs and treated with cycloheximide. After a 48-hour incubation, the treated cell lines are collected and subjected to a CellTiter-Glo ® (CTG) assay and RNA extraction. Data related to the cell lines and culture media are shown in Table 1 below. Table 1 Cells are harvested during the growth period and counted using a Cellometer K2. One million cells are incubated in the listed medium in each well of a six-well plate and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% C0 2 . After 24 hours, the medium is changed, the ASO is added, and incubation is continued under the same conditions for another 24 hours. Cycloheximide is then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Twenty-four hours after addition of the cycloheximide, the medium and cells are combined in a 15 mL conical tube and 50 pL aliquots of cells are added to a 96-well assay plate for CTG assaying. Luminescence is recorded using a BioTek Synergy neo2 Multi-mode Reader. The remaining cells are spun at 4 °C to collect a cell pellet for RNA extraction by Tryzol reagent. FIG. 1 shows results of the CTG assay described above for the SET-2 cell line. In the first column is the result for the assay vehicle, which contains no ASOs. Average relative luminescence units (RLUs) are in excess of 3,000,000. RLU is proportional to the number of viable cells in the assay well. The second column shows the results of the assay when off-target control ASOs (i.e., ASOs not targeting JAK2 pre-mRNA or mRNA) are used. Average RLUs are reduced as compared to vehicle, but are still in excess of 2,500,000. The third column of FIG. 1 shows the results of the assay when ASOs containing SEQ ID NO 4 or SEQ ID NO 5 are added. Here, average RLUs are reduced to less than 2,000,000, with some samples exhibiting a reduction to approximately 1,500,000. This constitutes a significant reduction in RLUs, and consequently cell viability, as compared to vehicle. These results are confirmed with RNA sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to quantify expression of the JAK2 gene. FIGS. 2A and 2B show, respectively, fluorescent (GFP) and brightfield images of assay wells for SET -2 cells treated with ASOs containing SEQ ID NO 4 or SEQ ID NO 5. FIGS. 3 A and 3B show, respectively, fluorescent and brightfield images for HEL cells treated with the same ASOs. In each case, fluorescence is lower than in untreated cells, demonstrating decreased mature JAK2 mRNA in samples incubated with ASOs containing SEQ ID NO 4 or SEQ ID NO 5. Thus, embodiments of the invention include the administration of an ASO containing SEQ ID NO 4, SEQ ID NO 5, or both, to an individual in order to inhibit expression of JAK2; such administration as a treatment for MDS, PV, or both; ASOs targeting SEQ ID NO 2, SEQ ID NO 3, or both; ASOs having nucleotide sequences that include SEQ ID NO 4 or SEQ ID NO 5; and compositions containing such ASOs in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, adjuvants, or combinations thereof. In other aspects, the present invention provides target sequences in the mutant IGHMBP2 pre-mRNA that are amenable to binding by a synthetic ASO. When so bound, expression of the mutant IGHMBP2 gene is inhibited. In patients diagnosed with CMT2S who are heterozygous for the mutation, such inhibition may result in the “rescue” or return to normal function of the IGHMBP2 protein. The full sequence of the wildtype IGHMBP2 gene is shown in the attached sequence listing as SEQ ID NO 6. The nucleotide at position 31401 is cytosine. In the mutation associated with CMT2S, this nucleotide is adenine. In one aspect of the present invention, a target region within the resulting mutant IGHMBP2 pre-mRNA molecule is identified that, when bound with an ASO, is capable of inhibiting synthesis of the mutant IGHMBP2 protein. That region within the mutant IGHMBP2 gene comprises a 19-bp sequence that includes the C31401 A mutation: C ACTT CC ACAGGGGG A AG A (SEQ ID NO 7). The complementary ASO sequence is: UCUUCCCCCUGUGGAAGUG (SEQ ID NO 8). An ASO comprising SEQ ID NO 3 bridges an intron and exon of the mutant IGHMBP2 pre-mRNA and, when bound to the pre-mRNA, prevents synthesis of the mutant IGHMBP2 protein. To test the efficacy of an ASO comprising SEQ ID NO 8 in binding to the mutant IGHMBP2 pre-mRNA and inhibiting mutant IGHMBP2 protein synthesis, a fibroblast cell line of a patient with CMT2S is incubated with an ASO including SEQ ID NO 8 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and treated with cycloheximide. After a 48-hour incubation, the treated cells are collected and for RNA extraction and Western Blot analysis to determine IGHMBP2 protein expression. More specifically, one million cells are incubated in 2 mL in the RPMI 1640 medium described above in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% carbon dioxide. After 24 hours, the medium is changed, the ASO is added, and incubation is continued for another 24 hours. Cycloheximide is then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Twenty-four hours after addition of the cyclohgeximide, the medium and cells are combined in a 15 mL conical tube and spun to collect a cell pellet for RNA extraction by Tryzol reagent. RNA extraction is carried out using, for example, Qiagen’s RNeasy Mini Kit. Western Blot analysis is then carried out to determine the concentration of wild type and mutant proteins in the samples. FIGS. 4A and 4B show fluorescent and brightfield photomicrographs, respectively, of SET-2 cells following treatment with ASOs including SEQ ID NO 8, demonstrating the ability of these ASOs to penetrate the cell membrane. FIGS. 5A and 5B show similar fluorescent and brightfield photomicrographs, respectively, of HEL cells following treatment with ASOs including SEQ ID NO 8. Again, these results demonstrate the ability of such ASOs to penetrate the cell membrane. ASOs other than or in addition to those including SEQ ID NO 8 may be useful in practicing the invention. Applicant has identified a “core” 11 nucleotide sequence within SEQ ID NO 8 that would provide a basis for sequences having sufficient specificity to enable discriminate binding of an ASO to the mutant IGHMBP2 pre- mRNA. As one skilled in the art will understand, efficient and effective ASO therapies such as those described herein require the use of ASOs having a length sufficient to ensure discriminate binding of the ASO to the target sequence. ASOs including sequences of between 13 nucleotides and 35 nucleotides in length and including the core sequence of SEQ ID NO 9 are of sufficient length for use in practicing embodiments of the invention. 5’-CCCCCUGUGGA-3 ’ (SEQ ID NO 9) Thus, an ASO having a nucleotide sequence that includes SEQ ID NO 4 and between two and 24 adjacent nucleotides are useful in practicing embodiments of the invention. Such nucleotide sequences include, for example, sequences as short as the 13-nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NOS, 10, 11, and 12: 5’-CCCCCUGUGGAAG-3 ’ (SEQ ID NO 10) 5 -UCCCCCUGUGGAA-3’ (SEQ ID NO 11) 5 -UUCCCCCUGUGGA-3’ (SEQ ID NO 12) Such nucleotide sequences also include, for example, sequences as long as the 35- nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NOS 13 and 14. 5’-GAAGAAAUCAAUCUUCCCCCUGUGGAAGUGAGGGC-3’ (SEQ ID NO 13) 5’-GAAAUCAAUCUUCCCCCUGUGGAAGUGAGGGCCAG-3’ (SEQ ID NO 14) More generally, ASOs having a nucleotide sequence between 13 nucleotides and 35 nucleotides in length comprising the core sequence of SEQ ID NO 9 and as many as 15 upstream nucleotides and/or 12 downstream nucleotides. The ASO “sequence window” is shown in SEQ ID NO 15. 5’-G A AG A A AIJCA AIJCI JI JCCCCCI JGI JGGAAGI JGAGGGCCAG-3 ’ (SEQ ID NO 15) As used herein, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms “comprises” and/or “comprising,” when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.
